# TODO

We recently changed this app to no longer offer guided meditation optional feature and to instead of optional story mode with dark sci fi and horror stories with accompanying poetry collections, and as a result we needed to significantly change the privacy policy for the iOS app. I've included that updated privacy policy as iOS_PRIVACY.md. We must also update this app's privavy policy, PRIVACY.md, in a similar fashion. But note that the Android app's age ratings are slightly different from the iOS app's age ratings...  Also, we've changed target audience in Play Store COnsole to only target 16-17 and 18+ categories. 

Here are the updated age ratiings in the Play Store based on the adjustments to the app:
