COLD WAKE


The sensors registered impossible:
a ship emerging from bent space
with no thermal signature, no trace
of heat. Every arrival is visible

through energy bleeding into real space—
conservation written into the fabric itself.
Compress distance, release it, and the spill
of radiation announces: something crossed this place.

But this ship arrived cold.

Cold as math that doesn't resolve.
The equations cannot absolve
what the instruments insist is so: a threshold

crossed without the cost.
Arrival without announcement.
Presence without the foundational testament
of having traveled. We are lost

in calibrations that won't fail,
in data that shouldn't exist but persists
past every check. Reality twists
and our certainties turn frail.

The ship sits in quarantine now—
dark hull iridescent like oil on bone,
curves that seem grown
rather than built. We ask how,

but the question fractures against wrongness
too fundamental to name.
Inside: soil. Not wreckage, not cargo—just earth.
The darkness of it fills the cabin like a secret

the universe kept until now.
It smells wrong. Sweet-rotten. Somehow
aware of being watched. Still

in its impossibility, patient
in its rupture. We touch it
and forget we're touching it.
Hours vanish. The ancient

thing in matter that remembers—
we feel it watching through particles too fine
to filter from our lungs. The fall
from certainty to fear dismembers

what we thought we understood.

The designation: UVO-1.
Unidentified Vessel Origin.
But origin suggests a source, a foreign
place it traveled from, and that's undone

by the cold arrival—a ship that couldn't
navigate itself, that violated
every law we calibrated
our survival on. We shouldn't

be able to see it. It shouldn't exist.
But it does, and now the soil
spreads through sealed containers, the coil
of wrongness tightening. We persist

in our measurements, desperate
to catalog the inexplicable,
to make the impossible explicable
through data. But the intimate

knowledge settling in our throats
is this: the warm wake we counted on,
the proof that physics holds, is gone—
replaced by cold that denotes

something stranger than malfunction,
deeper than our instruments can read.
The ship is a whisper, a seed
of doubt in reality's junction.

We catalog, we measure, we fear
what the cold arrival means:
that the universe intervenes
in our assumptions. That here,

in quarantine, contained but spreading,
sits evidence that laws we held
as absolute can be compelled
to break. The rupture is threading

through our facility, our minds,
the spaces between what must be
and what we see. Reality
no longer reminds

us of itself through predictable signs.

The ship arrived cold.
And we haven't stopped shivering since.
