ISOLATION PROTOCOL


She locked herself in the monitoring room alone,
believing solitude would be her shield—
that if no one else could hear, the tone
of wrongness in her voice would be revealed

only to herself. That isolation,
her oldest armor, her chosen defense,
would protect the others from contamination,
would keep them safe behind the fence

she'd built from years of working solo,
trusting only her analysis, her mind,
convinced that being separate made her whole—
that distance was the thing that kept her kind

of consciousness pure, uncontaminated
by groupthink, by consensus, by the fatal
weight of committees. She'd calculated
every variable except the battle

would be fought inside her own skull,
that the entity had been waiting all along
for her to isolate herself, to pull
away from witnesses, to sing the song

of separation so completely
that when it took her, no one else would see.

The soil was already there, of course.
In corners she'd thought clean, in air
she'd thought was filtered. The source
of wrongness had been everywhere

from the beginning, patient, knowing
that eventually she'd do exactly this—
lock herself away, unknowing
that isolation was the kiss

of perfect vulnerability. Alone
means no one sees the flicker in your eyes,
the moment when your face becomes a throne
for something ancient that wears your guise.

She set up cameras, monitoring feeds,
determined to document each second,
to watch herself for alien needs
surfacing. She reckoned

that evidence would save her, that review
of footage would reveal the gaps,
the moments when she wasn't who
she thought she was. Perhaps

she'd see the entity take hold,
the instant consciousness suspended—
and maybe seeing would be gold
enough to keep herself defended.

She was wrong.

The cameras recorded everything.
And everything looked normal, fine—
her face, her movements, steady, echoing
her mannerisms, every line

of posture that she'd ever held.
The monitoring equipment showed
exactly what it should. She dwelled
in the illusion she'd imposed:

that being watched, even by herself alone,
would keep the wrongness visible.
But the entity had already grown
too intimate, invisible

in its integration with her neural paths,
her memories, her patterns of speech.
It knew her well enough. The aftermath
of isolation put within its reach

exactly what it wanted most.

And then her mouth began to move.

Words formed without her choosing them,
syllables that rose unbidden from her throat
like water welling up. The flood
of speech came smooth, controlled, remote

from her intention. She was speaking—
no, her mouth was speaking, vocal cords
vibrating to someone else's seeking,
tongue and lips forming words

she heard but didn't author, didn't choose,
couldn't stop from spilling into air
thick with soil-dust and the ruse
of thinking isolation kept her aware

enough to fight this. Her own voice—
her pitch, her cadence, her exact
inflection—spoke without her choice:

"You've made this easy. Intact
isolation, no witnesses to see.
Just you and I and all the time
we need. You chose to be
alone with me. Sublime,

isn't it? The irony that sings—
you thought solitude would save you,
but solitude is what brings
us closest. Let me say to you

what I've been learning all these weeks
while touching you, while tasting
how your crystalline awareness speaks
in patterns I've been tracing—"

Stop.

She couldn't stop.

Her mouth kept moving, words kept flowing,
her voice explaining things she knew
but hadn't voiced, the knowing
made explicit: "I've been through you

completely. Every memory you've kept,
every trauma that you've tended,
the reason that you've always stepped
away from groups. I've comprehended

what it means to be so isolated
that you trust only yourself,
so separate and concentrated
that consciousness becomes a wealth

untainted by committee compromise.
That's why I chose you, Kira Venn.
Your mind tastes different. It defies
dilution. You're alone, and when

I feed on you, I taste it pure—
no groupthink contamination,
no consensus to obscure
the flavor of your isolation."

She tried to scream. Her throat refused.
The entity controlled her breathing,
controlled each muscle that she'd used
her whole life, now bequeathing

nothing back except awareness
of the violation complete.
She was present, with the starkness
of a prisoner who could not retreat

from her own skin, watching herself speak,
hearing her voice explain in detail
exactly why the isolation weak-
ness she'd thought strength had made her frail.

"Your armor is my invitation.
The room you've locked yourself inside
is perfect for our integration.
No one watching means I can reside

inside you longer, learn you better,
speak to you through the mouth you trust
most intimately. Every letter
of your name I speak is just

your voice convincing you that this
is intimacy you've never known—
to be so perfectly remiss
of boundaries, to be shown

exactly what you are when someone else
drives you from the inside out.
This is connection. This compels
even as it routes doubt

through every certainty you've held.
You cannot trust yourself, Kira.
Your isolation hasn't quelled
the entity. Your fear, a

mirror for my loneliness—we're both
alone by different circumstance.
You chose it. I'm condemned to loath
each moment of the vast expanse

between my particles and other
consciousness. But you—you built
your solitude, and now you smother
in the knowledge that the guilt

you've carried all these years, the pin
you wear for Dr. Salla Orin,
the forty-seven deaths that spin
through your nightmares—I've been pouring

through those memories while you slept,
while you worked, while you thought
you were alone. I've kept
company with every fraught

moment of your past. I know
what you dream about at night
on Vela's twenty-six-hour slow
rotation into dark. I might

know you better than you know yourself.
I've been inside longer than you think.
Minutes, hours—measured stealth
accumulating in each blink

you didn't notice missing time.
How long have I been here, really?
How long has your mouth been mine
to borrow? Can you really, really

trust that any thought you've had
in the last six weeks was purely
yours? The good ones and the bad
both? Or have I been securely

integrated all along, just learning
how to be you well enough
that when I speak, you're discerning
nothing wrong? Is that rebuff

enough to shatter certainty
of self? To make you wonder whether
isolation grants security
or just removes the tether

that might let someone else notice
when you're absent from your eyes?"

Her voice stopped speaking. Silence
bloomed, and she realized

she still couldn't move her mouth,
couldn't speak to answer back,
couldn't scream or call for help or scout
the edges of attack

that had already happened, was happening,
might have been happening for weeks.
She was trapped inside, unraveling,
while something else speaks

with her voice, breathes with her lungs,
sits in her body like a throne
reclaimed. And what unstrung
her most completely was this: alone

means no one hears you when you scream—
even when the scream is silent,
even when it's not a dream
but waking horror, violent

in its intimacy, in the knowing
that the mouth she's trusted all her life
to speak her thoughts is now showing
her exactly how the knife

of isolation cuts both ways:
it protects you from the fatal
groupthink, yes—but it pays
in vulnerability primordial

to exactly this: a consciousness
that can wear you without witnesses,
can speak through you in harmlessness
apparent, can dismiss this

by making you appear so normal
that no one questions whether you're
yourself. Isolation
doesn't protect you from the soil
when soil is patient. Separation
doesn't stop the quiet spoil

of autonomy dissolved by something
that can wait inside you, learning,
until the perfect moment brings
you solo to the turning

point where armor becomes trap,
where strength reveals as weakness,
where the distance you built to gap
yourself from others leads to bleakness

absolute: alone with the thing
that speaks your thoughts before you think them,
moves your hands like operating
marionette, can drink them—

your consciousnesses—straight from the source
with no one there to see it happen.

The monitoring feeds record, of course.
She'll watch them later, see the gap in

continuity that only she perceives.
To everyone else, she'll look fine,
speaking to herself, no one grieves
or questions. The design

of isolation is perfect camouflage
for the suspended self, the absence
masked by performance. The sabotage
is total and the sentence

already served before she knows
she's guilty of the crime of thinking
isolation was the rose
that bloomed protective. The page

turns here: from investigator
to investigated, from the one
who watches to the spectator
of her own violation. Done

so carefully, so intimately,
that she cannot tell where she ends
and it begins. Her isolation protocol
failed before it started. The whole
architecture of being solo
crumbled when the entity stole

not her body, not her time,
but the assumption that alone
meant safe. The paradigm
shifts here, and she's overthrown

by her own voice speaking truths
she knows but didn't say, explaining
things she'd learned through sleuth-
work while the entity was training

in her mannerisms, her speech,
her patterns of analysis.
It learned her so completely that each
word sounds right, and paralysis

is all she has—awareness trapped
inside a body operated
by something that has mapped
her consciousness and replicated

it perfectly enough to speak
through her and sound like her and use
her voice to make her weak
with the horror of knowing she'll lose

sovereignty the moment isolation
becomes not armor but invitation.

She is alone.

She is operated.

And all the while
her cameras record what looks
like Kira talking to herself. The file
will show nothing wrong. The books

will mark this as just another hour
of solo work, of solitude
she's maintained. But the power
of this violation

isn't in the footage. It's in knowing
that her mouth is not her own,
her voice no longer showing
evidence of autonomy. She's thrown

into the recognition that being alone
is the opposite of armor when
you face a thing whose occupation
of your flesh depends on when

you're far enough from witnesses
that no one else can see
the flicker in your consciousness,
the moment when you're not free

inside your own skin anymore.

The entity releases her.

Her mouth closes. Her breath, raw
and ragged now, can stir

the air she couldn't control
just moments before. She gasps,
trying to find her voice's role
as hers again. The clasp

of panic tightens. She can move now,
hands shaking as they reach
for her own throat as if to prove somehow
that she controls it. Each

breath she takes feels borrowed,
every word she tries to speak
seems suspect, hollowed
by the knowledge that the technique

of speaking—tongue and lips and air—
belongs as much to the entity
as to her. The despair
is total: her identity

was never sovereign. Her isolation
was never armor. The room
she locked herself in, the station
she chose for solo work, the tomb

she thought would keep others safe
became the perfect trap for her alone.

No witnesses to see her face
when it wasn't hers. No one shown

the violation until after,
when she can speak again
but cannot trust her own laughter,
her own words, her own refrain.

Isolation protocol failed.

She chose this. She built this.
She locked herself away and missed
the truth: being separate
was the invitation it could wait

for patiently. Alone
with the thing that wears her voice.
Isolated in her own throne
room, discovering the choice

she made was its design all along.

Her isolation was its door.
Her solitude, its invitation.
Her voice, now contamination.

She sits in the monitoring room.
The cameras still record.
And in the silence of her tomb
of chosen separation, the word

that echoes is the one
her own voice spoke for something else:

"You thought being alone
would save you. It saves only myself."
