THE GAPS


There are hours I cannot account for.
Seventeen, to be precise—
though precision is a mockery
when the thing being measured
is absence itself.

Not sleep. Not unconscious.
Functioning, they tell me.
Speaking. Walking. Working.
Performing complex tasks
with my hands that were
not my hands at all.

What do you call the space
between one moment of yourself
and the next moment of yourself
when something else
has occupied the interim?

Not blackout—that implies
a light extinguished, then rekindled.
This is different. This is
the light burning continuously
for everyone watching,
while you—
the you that lives behind your eyes—

simply weren't there.

And the question that keeps me
awake during Vela's twenty-six-hour nights:
where did I go?

Not unconscious. Not sleeping.
Not dead, not erased, not ended.
Just... elsewhere. Suspended
in a gap that has no geography,
a pause that took no time
from the outside
but took everything
from within.

I've read the logs I wrote
in my own handwriting, describing
analyses I don't remember performing.
I've watched security footage of myself
moving with purpose, methodical,
my face bearing the expression
I make when concentrating—

and I remember none of it.

The continuity of self
is a lie we tell ourselves.
A narrative we construct
from moment to moment,
stitching together instances of awareness
into something that feels
like continuous existence.

But consciousness is not continuous.
It's discrete moments, gap gap gap gap,
faster than perception—
the spaces filled by the brain's insistence
that you are always you.

Except when you're not.

Seventeen hours.

In that time, something wore me
like I wear clothes.
Put on my body, my voice, my mannerisms.
Moved through the world
as a perfect simulation of Kira Venn,
complete enough that no one noticed
the original had been
temporarily evicted.

And here's what haunts me most:
I didn't feel it happen.

No violation I could sense,
no moment of transition,
no awareness of suspension.
Just time that was there
and then wasn't,
consciousness that existed
and then resumed
with nothing to mark the gap
except the clock's indictment
and the evidence of actions taken
by hands I thought were mine.

How many smaller gaps
did I not notice?

Minutes lost. Seconds.
The space between one breath
and the next, brief enough
that continuity seemed intact
but long enough for something else
to move my hand,
to touch the soil,
to read my memories
like files left open on a screen.

I am trying to trust myself.
I am failing.

Because the self I'm trying to trust
has proven itself to be
intermittent, revocable, conditional—
a tenancy that can be suspended
without notice or awareness,
leaving the property occupied
but the owner absent.

They tell me I'm safe now.
The entity is scattered, fragmented,
unable to reach me across
the distances we imposed.

But the gaps remain.
Seventeen hours I will never recover,
actions I performed but cannot remember,
words I spoke that left no echo
in the place where memory should live.

And I cannot escape the thought
that maybe consciousness itself
is just a gap we fill with stories,
a space between neurons firing
that we populate with the illusion
of continuous existence,
of being always present
in the vessel we inhabit.

Maybe we're all gaps pretending
to be wholes.

Maybe identity is just
the narrative we tell about the spaces,
and what happened to me—
the suspension, the absence,
the hours operated by something else—

is only unusual
in that I noticed the gap
instead of papering over it
with false memory
and the comfortable lie
of continuous self.

I write this to prove I'm here.
I write this to mark the moment
of my own awareness,
to document the instance
of being present
in my own existence.

But even as I write,
I cannot shake the feeling
that presence is just
another gap I haven't noticed yet,

and somewhere in the space
between this word
and the next,

I might not be
who I think I am.

The gaps are always there.
Most of us never see them.
I've seen them now—
those seventeen hours
where I wasn't—

and I cannot unsee
the discontinuity
at the heart of being.

Cannot unknow
that consciousness
is not the solid thing
we pretend it is,

but something fragile,
intermittent,
full of spaces
we pretend aren't there

until something shows us
the gap

and we realize
we've been absent
all along.
