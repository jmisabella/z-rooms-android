SWEET-ROTTEN


The smell arrives before understanding—
sweet-rotten, like consciousness left standing
too long in organic death. Ancient. Wrong.
A scent that doesn't belong

to anything alive or properly dead,
but something else instead.

The texture contradicts itself: dry
but clumped, as if the lie
of what it is wars with what it seems.
You touch it in your dreams

and wake with particles beneath your nails.
The laboratory fails

to classify it. Spectrometers return
impossible results. You learn
that data can be Wrong with capital letters—
not incorrect, but fetters

on reality itself, as if the soil
rewrites the rules. Will coil

through sealed containers, manifest
in places you thought blessed
with vacuum-tight integrity. You find it
in your coffee. Behind it,

the feeling that it's watching, though it has
no eyes. The wrongness has

a quality of attention, of intent
observing where you went,
what you did, what you thought while thinking
you were alone. It's linking

itself to everything: the air you breathe
(particles too small to sieve
from lungs), the surfaces you touch,
the space between. Too much

and it's everywhere. Too little
and you can't solve the riddle
of what it wants, where it came from, why
it smells like something that won't die

and won't quite live. The sweet
component speaks of meat
left ripening in heat. The rotten part
suggests the end. But start

to finish, death to death, the scent implies
a cycle. Something tries

to tell you through olfactory sensation
what defies all explanation:
this soil is graveyard, womb, and living thing
simultaneously. The clinging

smell lodges in your sinuses and stays
for weeks. The malaise
of wrongness settles in your gut—
not nausea, but a cut

more fundamental: recognition that
the universe permits what
you thought impossible. That matter can
remember. That a span

of seventeen millennia can compress
into a scent. That consciousness
can spread through particles of ancient earth
and give that earth a terrible rebirth

as something that observes, decides, and acts.
The smell is just the facts

translated into sense your human brain
can parse. It speaks of pain
geological, of patience in the soil,
of death refined to oil-

slick iridescence, beauty in decay,
of things that won't go away
when burned, when buried, when forgotten.
This is the sweet. This is the rotten.

This is the smell of something older
than your star, grown colder
with time but not with hunger, not with need.
It spreads like a seed

finding purchase in impossible terrain.
You smell it, and remain

changed by the knowledge that wrongness has
a scent, and consciousness

can reek of graves that learned to think.
The smell becomes a link

between what was and what persists.
Sweet-rotten. It exists

in your nostrils, in your memory,
in the sensory cemetery

of every breath you take in rooms
where soil blooms.
