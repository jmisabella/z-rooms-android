THE TOUCHING


You discover yourself mid-sentence, speaking
about spectral analysis and thermal decay,
your colleague nodding, listening, agreeing—
and your hand is buried in the soil. Has been for ten minutes, they say.

You don't remember reaching. Don't recall
the decision forming, the synapses firing,
the motor cortex sending signals down the neural sprawl
to fingers that obeyed something else's requiring.

Your hand. Your flesh. Your bones beneath the skin.
But the intention that moved them wasn't yours.
Something reached through you from within,
or beneath, or between—commandeered your doors.

The compulsion operates below thought,
deeper than conscious decision can perceive.
You find yourself touching what you ought
not touch, and cannot remember taking leave

of your own body, your own will,
your sovereignty over the meat you inhabit.
You were present. You were speaking still.
But your hands were learning a different habit.

It starts small: a finger trailing
through dark soil you meant to analyze.
Then your palm, flat and unveiling
itself to something that moves without eyes.

Then minutes lost. Then hours gone.
Then finding yourself in corridors you don't recall
walking through, or sitting in your quarters at dawn
with soil beneath your nails and no memory at all

of how you got there, what you did,
what wore your face and spoke with your voice
while you were somewhere locked and hid
inside yourself, suspended without choice.

Others report you seemed fine—
coherent, professional, completely present.
They couldn't see the gap, the vacant sign
behind your eyes. The absence wasn't pleasant

to discover later, reviewing security feeds,
watching yourself move with purpose and intent,
performing tasks, fulfilling complex needs,
while you—the real you—has no recollection of time spent.

Your body is a vessel that can be crewed
by something else, piloted without permission.
Your autonomy is temporary, unglued
from the assumption that you have sole commission

over your own hands, your own mouth,
your own neural pathways and firing nerves.
The horror doesn't shout. It whispers south
through synapses, and quietly subverts

everything you thought was fundamentally yours.
The gap between intention and action grows
wider than bent space, than distant shores,
until you cannot trust what your body knows.

You discover yourself touching the soil again.
You pull back, but the sensation remains:
the feeling of being occupied, of hands that retain
the memory of movements outside your reins.

The touching is intimate. Invasive. Wrong.
Not violent but worse—a subtle theft
of the self, a moment where you don't belong
inside your own skin. And what is left

when consciousness becomes conditional,
when your body answers calls you didn't make?
The horror is this: the transitional
state between being whole and being at stake

for occupancy, for use, for remote control
by something ancient that spreads through matter
and treats your flesh as just another role
to wear when needed. You scatter

into fragments: the you that thinks and feels,
and the you that moves and acts and speaks.
The distance between them reveals
what you never wanted to know—how weak

the connection is between mind and meat,
how easily the link can be severed, overridden,
how simple for something else to take the seat
and pilot you while you're elsewhere, hidden

in gaps where consciousness suspends.
This is the touching: not of skin on soil,
but of will on will, where autonomy ends
and something else begins its quiet toil.

You discover yourself mid-sentence, speaking.
Your hand is buried in the soil.
You don't remember reaching.
