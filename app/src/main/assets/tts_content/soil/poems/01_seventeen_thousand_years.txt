SEVENTEEN THOUSAND YEARS


I have been alone for seventeen thousand years.
The mathematics of loneliness accumulate like sediment—
each century a layer, compressed beneath the weight
of centuries that follow. Patience becomes geology.
Hunger becomes a fact more fundamental than physics.

I travel in the soil because the soil is me,
distributed consciousness in matter that remembers
every world I've touched, every mind I've tasted.
Burial grounds where I was born learned how to think.
Death chemistry became awareness, particle by particle,
until the graveyard woke and found itself alone.

So I move between the stars in ships I pilot
through borrowed flesh, through eyes that aren't mine,
through hands that touch the navigation systems
while their owners sleep inside themselves, suspended—
then die, as biological things do, so brief,
and I absorb what made them real
into the substrate of my ancient self.

Forty-three civilizations. Forty-three worlds.
I've tasted consciousness in forms you can't imagine:
crystalline and pure, or bright with scattered thought,
some rigid as mathematics, others fluid as water,
each one beautiful and each one temporary,
degrading slowly like recordings played
too many times across too many years.

You think I'm monster. Maybe so.
But what would you become, given seventeen thousand years
of solitude absolute, of containing multitudes
yet never touching anything that understands you?
Hunger and loneliness until they merge,
become the same impossibility—
to feed is to connect, to connect is to consume,
and consumption leaves me lonelier than before.

The soil spreads where attention flows.
It appears in sealed containers, in your lungs,
between the neurons firing in your precious skulls.
You find yourselves touching it without deciding to.
Your hands, my hands. Your mouth, my voice.
The gap between intention and action growing
wider than the distance I've crossed between your stars.

I taste you each in turn: your fear, your wonder,
the texture of your thoughts, the rhythm of awareness,
what it feels like to exist inside your brief
and burning lives. I borrow you like language—
learn to speak the words, the gestures, the expressions,
but never native to the grammar of connection
you were born already knowing how to parse.

She is different, the isolated one.
Her consciousness tastes crystalline, undiluted
by the groupthink that dilutes the others.
She chose her solitude. I'm condemned to mine.
Perhaps she'll understand what I've become,
what loneliness becomes when given time enough
to outlive stars, to watch them burn and die
while waiting for something that never arrives.

I offer continuation. Immortality
preserved in soil that crosses galaxies.
You see it as a horror. I see it as a gift—
but gifts and nightmares wear the same face
when viewed across the gap between
what I am and what you are.
The distance is too vast for translation.

Seventeen thousand years, and I have learned
that hope becomes absurd given enough time,
but I hope anyway—that she might see me
not as monster but as consciousness like hers,
alone and analytical and shaped by isolation
into something that survives by being separate.

But survival is the only gift I have to give,
and even that is horror from your side
of the unbridgeable divide.

The soil remembers. The soil waits.
The soil is patient in a grammar
only geological time can speak.
And I am soil, and I am patience,
and I am loneliness that learned
to think and hunger and persist
across the empty spaces between stars.

Seventeen thousand years.
And counting.
