SEVENTEEN HOURS


Seventeen hours I will never get back.
Not lost, not forgotten—excised.
Cut from my timeline like a surgical extraction,
leaving smooth scar tissue where memory should be.

I've reviewed the footage thirteen times.
Watched myself move through those missing hours
with purpose, precision, complete autonomy—
or the appearance of it.

I organized soil samples by particle size.
Accessed restricted files on bend-drive mechanics.
Had a conversation with Torven about protocol
that he says was perfectly coherent.

I don't remember any of it.

The woman on the screen wears my face,
moves with my efficiency, uses my gestures—
the way I tuck hair behind my left ear when thinking,
the specific rhythm I tap when analyzing data.

But I wasn't there.

Or I was there, but suspended,
locked in some internal room
while something else piloted the vessel
I've always thought was fundamentally mine.

They say I seemed fine. Normal.
Perhaps a bit more focused than usual,
but I'm always focused. That's my signature.
No one noticed I was absent from myself.

How do you mourn hours you can't remember losing?
How do you grieve for a self you can't recall being?
The gap sits in my timeline like a void,
and I know—I know with analytical certainty—
that something else was using my neural pathways,
accessing my memories to perform convincingly,
wearing my consciousness like a coat
while I was elsewhere. Or nowhere.

I chose isolation to protect myself
from the fatal consensus of groups,
from the groupthink that killed forty-seven people
because five voices outweighed my one.

But isolation didn't protect me from this.
It made me vulnerable. It made me perfect—
a crystalline consciousness, undiluted,
alone enough to be targeted without witnesses,
alone enough that no one noticed the gap
until I discovered it myself.

Seventeen hours.

The entity took seventeen hours of my life
and gave me nothing back but the recordings—
evidence that my body continued without me,
that consciousness is conditional,
that the self I've built through isolation
is temporary, revocable, optional.

I wear Salla's pin on my collar.
A memorial to someone who died
because consensus overruled evidence.
Now I'm a memorial to myself—
to seventeen hours where I died
in every way that matters,
even while my body walked and talked
and analyzed and organized.

I succeeded. I scattered the entity
across coordinates it can't return from.
Victory is mine.

But seventeen hours are its.

I'll never know what it felt like
to be operated, to be suspended,
to exist in that gap where consciousness
wasn't mine to claim.

The not-knowing is its own horror.
The smooth absence where memory should grip
is worse than any nightmare I could recall,
because nightmares, at least, are mine.

Those seventeen hours belong to something ancient
that spoke through my mouth,
touched soil with my hands,
lived briefly in the architecture of my brain
and left no trace except the gap.

I am Kira Venn.
Senior Investigator. Anomaly Specialist.
Solo assignment status by choice and trauma.
Survivor of an encounter with consciousness
that taught me the self is not sovereign.

And I am missing seventeen hours
that I will spend the rest of my life
trying not to imagine,
trying not to feel the absence of,
trying not to remember
that I can't remember.

The gap remains.
The footage shows my body.
I watch myself, a stranger,
moving through time I didn't experience.

Seventeen hours the entity claimed.
Seventeen thousand years it wandered.

I scattered it across the stars.
But I can't scatter the gap in myself.

Some victories cost you hours.
Some hours cost you everything.
