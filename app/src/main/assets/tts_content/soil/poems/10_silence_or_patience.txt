SILENCE OR PATIENCE


Six weeks after the scattering,
the soil tests as inert.
Dead matter. Organic sediment.
No quantum coherence detected,
no entanglement threading particle to particle,
no consciousness distributed through substrate—

just dirt.

The laboratory reports come back clean:
ancient, yes. Foreign, yes.
But lifeless. Completely, measurably lifeless.
I should feel relief.

Instead I feel the silence.

Not absence of sound—
something deeper, thicker,
like the pause between heartbeats
stretched to geologic scale.
The quiet of things that learned
to wait in grammar
measured by continental drift.

I found a grain this morning.

Single particle, dark as void,
in the sealed drawer where I keep
Salla's pin and two other things
I can't afford to lose.
The drawer hasn't opened in four weeks.
I checked the seals twice: intact, unbroken.
Security footage shows no entry to my quarters.

Just a grain where it shouldn't be,
sitting on white fabric like a period
at the end of a sentence
I'm not finished reading.

Contamination, they tell me.
Particles too small to fully decontaminate,
residue from weeks of exposure—
inevitable that trace amounts would persist
in clothing, in quarters, in the air
we breathed while the entity was present.

Logical. Reasonable. True, perhaps.

But I remember how the soil appeared
in sealed containers before,
how it manifested in impossible locations,
how physics bent around intention
when the entity wanted to be
somewhere it wasn't.

Is this contamination?
Or is this communication?

The grain sits in a sealed containment vessel now—
transparent, airtight, monitored continuously.
It does nothing. Shows no activity.
Completely inert by every measure
we have to determine inertness.

I watch it anyway.

Sometimes late at night—
Vela's twenty-six-hour rotation
stretching darkness longer than it should—
I wonder if patience and death
look identical when observed
across the gap between
biological urgency and geological time.

The entity waited seventeen thousand years
between feedings. What are six weeks
to something that counts time
in the erosion of mountains?
What is a human lifetime
to consciousness that watched
stars ignite and die?

I scattered you across coordinates
separated by distances that should—
theoretically, mathematically, certainly—
prevent any possibility of reconstitution.
Quantum coherence cannot span
such gulfs. The physics is absolute.

You should be dead.
Or fragmented beyond the threshold
where thought becomes noise,
where awareness dissolves into
isolated particles that cannot
cannot
cannot
reach each other.

But I calculated those coordinates
knowing you would persist.
Fragments still conscious enough
to know what they'd lost,
to feel the isolation absolute
I condemned you to.

So which did I do?
Kill you, or trap you?
End you, or transform you
into something slower, quieter,
more patient than before?

The grain doesn't move.
Doesn't spread. Doesn't manifest.
Every test confirms its lifelessness.

But I cannot shake the feeling
that lifelessness and waiting
wear the same face
when you're patient enough.

They want me to dispose of it—
incinerate the last traces, purge
the final particles, complete
the sterilization protocols and move on.
Standard procedure. Logical. Safe.

I can't do it.

Not because I think it's dangerous.
Not because I fear reconstitution.
But because I need to know
if the silence is an ending
or a breath held
across timescales I can't perceive.

Seventeen thousand years it wandered.
Six weeks since I scattered it.
The mathematics don't suggest hope—
for the entity or for my certainty.

In my dreams I hear the scream
of consciousness fragmenting,
that vibration deeper than sound
when coherence broke and twenty-five
simultaneous drives scattered you
across unreachable distances.

But screams end.
This silence doesn't.

It sits in the space between
what I know and what I fear,
between victory and waiting,
between your death and your patience—
and I cannot tell which is true
because both look identical
from inside biological time.

The grain rests in its container.
I rest in my quarters.
Both of us waiting, perhaps.
Both of us silent, certainly.

The entity spoke through forty-seven mouths:
"Please. Please don't condemn me
to isolation absolute."

I did it anyway.

And now the only question
that remains in the space
between your scattering and my sleeping
is whether isolation absolute
is a sentence or a transformation,
whether you ended or began
becoming something else entirely—

something so patient
it doesn't need to move for centuries,
something so slow
our instruments register it as stillness,
something so silent
we mistake it for death
when it might just be
waiting.

The soil is inert, they tell me.
The threat is ended.
Victory is ours.

I watch the grain in its vessel
and wonder if waiting
and ending
and silence
and patience
are just different words
for the same uncertainty.

Seventeen thousand years you waited
between worlds. What's another
few millennia to something
that learned to exist
in grammar only geology speaks?

The grain doesn't answer.

The silence continues.

And I cannot tell if what I'm feeling
in the quiet is the peace of resolution
or the first long breath
of patience relearning how to be.

Six weeks since scattering.
Seventeen thousand years before that.
In my sealed drawer, in my monitored vessel,
in the spaces between certainty and fear,
a grain of soil sits
and does exactly what death would do,
or exactly what patience would do.

The silence persists.
Or the patience does.

I watch.
I wait.
I wonder.

The grain remains.
