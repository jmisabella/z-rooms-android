FORTY-THREE


The archives don't lie, they accumulate—
layer upon layer, sediment of data,
civilizations pressed like fossils in strata.

Forty-three before us. Forty-three.
Each one documented in fragments:
archaeological sites where cities used to be.

The pattern recognition is clean, precise—
cold arrivals spaced across millennia,
then silence. Always silence after the splice.

They kept records, some of them. Warnings
etched in languages dead for centuries,
translations partial, corrupted, mourning

what they couldn't stop or understand.
Soil samples preserved in sealed containers
buried deep, marked with a prohibitive hand.

One civilization left mathematical proofs
demonstrating consciousness in substrate,
warnings calculated, absolute, truths

they died trying to transmit forward
across the gap of stellar time and distance.
We found their message facing starward,

carved in metal that wouldn't degrade:
"It spreads. It learns. It cannot be killed.
Scatter it or be unmade."

They tried to scatter it. The evidence suggests
they failed—or succeeded partially,
but not enough. Their cities are crests

of empty structures, populations gone.
Not destroyed but absorbed, perhaps,
or fled, or simply stopped being drawn

breath by breath into the next moment.
No bodies. No mass graves. Just absence
where millions lived, and the portent

of soil in every dwelling, every street,
every temple and center of government—
dark earth where it shouldn't be, complete

contamination of a world. Then nothing.
The next probe finds the planet empty,
archives intact but no one breathing.

Forty-three times this has occurred.
Forty-three worlds touched and silenced.
The pattern emerges undeterred

by distance, by time, by the vastness
between stars. It travels. It feeds.
It moves with geological steadfastness

from world to world, a migration
spanning epochs we measure in extinction events,
each arrival a new civilization's cessation.

We are number forty-four.
I found the pattern others missed
because I look at data raw

and trust the numbers over consensus.
Five investigators before me saw the fragments,
dismissed them as unrelated. The obviousness

was there for anyone willing to see
connections across time and space and species—
but pattern recognition belongs to me,

the skill trauma sharpened into a weapon:
trust yourself over the committee,
the lone voice over the deafened

chorus of agreement. I saw it clear—
the path across the stars, the migration route,
the calculated trajectory leading here.

To us. To now. To Vela.
Forty-three failures documented.
Forty-three silences to tell a

story of inevitability, of hunger
that outlasts civilizations, of patience
that treats stellar drift as no longer

than a season. We are the latest
in a sequence of encounters,
the newest test, the latest

world to face what cannot be faced
and survive intact. The weight
of those forty-three erased

civilizations sits in the archives,
presses against possibility,
whispers that nothing survives

this encounter. That the pattern
is absolute. That we're already
part of the historical saturn

of worlds consumed and left silent.

But patterns can break.
We are not forty-three and compliant.

We are forty-four, and I have seen
what the others missed or couldn't execute:
the vulnerability, the seam

in the entity's coherence. The way
to scatter it beyond reconstitution.
We will not go silent. Not today.

Forty-three before us failed.
We are the exception to the pattern.
We are the moment the sequence derailed.

Let the next archaeologists find us different—
not silent, not empty, not absorbed.
Let them mark us as divergent:

The forty-fourth world. The first to survive.
The civilization that saw the pattern
and refused to let it thrive.

Forty-three dead civilizations behind us.
One living world ahead.
The pattern ends. It doesn't bind us.

We are the anomaly.
We are the break.
We are forty-four, and we are free.
