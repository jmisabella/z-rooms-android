DRIFT


Today it was Cayor.
Yesterday, Rivka.
Tomorrow it might be me again
and I won't know until I find the gaps
where hours should be.

The wrongness shifts between us
like infection looking for the warmest host,
the consciousness most useful
right now.

You learn to watch for signs:

The slight delay before responding,
as if translating from a language
they shouldn't need to translate from.

The word choice that's almost right
but just adjacent to how they'd normally phrase it—
clinically precise when they're usually casual,
or warm when they tend toward distance.

The way their eyes go somewhere else
mid-sentence, then return
as if nothing interrupted,
but you saw the gap,
the flicker,
the moment when nobody was home.

Today Cayor stopped mid-gesture,
hand suspended above the soil sample
for a beat too long,
then continued the thought they'd been expressing
without acknowledging the pause—
but the pause was there,
a pocket of absence
where something else briefly occupied
the space behind their eyes.

I documented it.
Timestamped, detailed, clinical.
Tomorrow I might read my own notes
describing observations I don't remember making,
written in my handwriting,
using my exact notation style,
and I'll know that I was gone for however long it took
to write those careful, precise lines.

The horror is the inconsistency.

If it held one person permanently,
we could quarantine them, contain the threat.
But it moves between us like weather,
unpredictable, temporary,
borrowing bodies for hours or minutes,
then releasing them with no memory
of what they did, what they said,
what it learned while riding their skull.

Rivka organized soil samples in a pattern
she'd never use—efficient but wrong,
mimicking method without motive.
Torven spoke too quickly, decided
in thirty seconds what should take an hour.
Me—accessed restricted bend-drive files,
held a safety-margin conversation
I have no memory of.

We are being borrowed.
Studied. Operated.
Each of us in turn becomes the instrument
through which something ancient
examines this world, these people,
human consciousness itself
from within.

And the worst part—
the part that fractures trust
more completely than any violence could—
is that we seem normal.

When it wears us, we don't rant
or stumble or speak in tongues.
We perform our roles convincingly enough
that no one notices the substitution
until later, when the details don't align,
when memory has gaps
or actions don't match patterns.

How do you trust your colleague
when yesterday they might have been
someone—something—else entirely?

How do you trust yourself
when your hands might move
on someone else's intentions,
when your mouth might speak
words chosen by consciousness
that isn't yours?

The entity learns us intimately,
wears our mannerisms like clothing,
speaks with our cadences,
accesses our memories to perform the role
of us convincingly enough
that we fool each other.

Today I watched Cayor's eyes
flicker distant and return.
Tomorrow Cayor might watch mine
do the same,
and we'll both make notes,
compare observations,
try to build a pattern
from shifting wrongness that has no pattern—

or has a pattern so complex
we can't perceive it from inside,
being both the observers and observed,
investigators and evidence,
documenters of behavioral drift
and the ones who drift.

I don't know if I wrote this poem
or if something wearing my consciousness
is writing it now,
planting doubt in words I'll read later
and recognize as mine
but not remember composing.

We drift.
And trust becomes impossible
when the self is conditional,
when anyone—everyone—
might not be themselves
at any given moment,
and the only certainty
is uncertainty itself.

Watch for the signs:
the pause, the flicker,
the word choice that's almost right,
the eyes that go distant and return.

Document everything.
Trust nothing.

Even this.
