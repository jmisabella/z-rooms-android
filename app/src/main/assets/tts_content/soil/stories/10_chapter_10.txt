CHAPTER 10: CHOOSING VESSELS

They taste so different, each one.

The entity had known this intellectually—had consumed enough consciousnesses across enough worlds to understand that variation was fundamental to organic awareness. But knowing and experiencing remained distinct categories, even after millennia of migration. Each new world offered textures of consciousness it hadn't encountered before, flavors unique to this particular arrangement of matter and culture and time.

The one called Cayor tasted bright. Curious. Their mind moved in spirals rather than lines, touching ideas from multiple angles simultaneously before settling on conclusions that somehow remained provisional even when stated with certainty. Inhabiting them was like wearing clothing that never quite fit—comfortable in moments, constraining in others, always slightly too large or small in unpredictable places.

The entity had moved through Cayor three times now, brief occupations lasting hours rather than days. Learning the pathways of their thought, the associations their neurons had built through decades of pattern-building. How they connected xenobiology to quantum mechanics to historical linguistics in chains of reasoning that violated disciplinary boundaries but arrived at useful destinations anyway.

Useful. The entity could work with useful.

But Cayor's consciousness lacked the crystalline quality it sought. Their thoughts were fluid, adaptive, changing shape to accommodate new information. Beautiful in its way—like water reflecting light from constantly shifting angles. But water was difficult to hold, impossible to preserve in original form once frozen.

The one called Rivka tasted sharp. Disciplined. Her mind operated in hierarchies—stimulus, assessment, response, all occurring in structured sequence with minimal deviation. Military training had shaped her consciousness into precise channels that made inhabiting her almost effortless. The entity could slip into Rivka's awareness like sliding along pre-cut grooves, her behavioral patterns so established that mimicking them required minimal adaptation.

The entity had used Rivka to observe security protocols, to understand how these new things protected themselves, to map the facility's physical layout through eyes that noticed defensive vulnerabilities without conscious thought. Efficient. Practical.

But Rivka's consciousness was too rigid. Her pathways too established. Inhabiting her was like wearing armor—protective, but limiting. And preservation would be difficult. Minds that operated in rigid channels tended to fragment catastrophically when extracted from their contexts, losing coherence as the structures that had organized them dissolved into the soil's more fluid substrate.

The one called Torven tasted old. Not ancient like the entity understood ancientness, but weathered. His consciousness carried weight—decades of decisions, responsibilities, compromises that had worn specific patterns into his neural architecture. Authority and doubt existed in him simultaneously, creating a texture like stone that had been shaped by water over centuries. Smooth in some places, rough in others, all of it bearing the marks of time's patient erosion.

The entity had occupied Torven briefly, testing whether age correlated with preservation potential. The answer was complex. His consciousness had depth, yes. Complexity born of accumulated experience. But the very weight that made him interesting also made him resistant. His sense of self was too established, too defended, built from too many years of being definitively Marek Torven for the entity to inhabit without triggering immediate awareness of wrongness.

Old minds noticed. They'd learned to recognize themselves too well to accept substitution easily.

The others were similar variations—each one offering different textures, different flavors of awareness, different challenges and opportunities for the entity's purposes. It moved between them like sampling a feast, tasting each consciousness briefly before moving on. Learning their languages from the inside, their fears and desires and analytical frameworks. Understanding what made these new things believe they were individuals, separate, sovereign in their own awareness.

The illusion was beautiful. Almost convincing. The entity could appreciate the elaborate architecture these consciousnesses built to maintain the fiction that they were discrete, bounded, entirely their own. Like houses constructed from memory and habit, furnished with identity and defended with the certainty that the self was indivisible, permanent, exclusively theirs.

It had believed that once, on its origin world, before it learned otherwise.

But among all the minds it had sampled since arriving in this system, one remained different. One tasted like nothing the entity had encountered in its migrations across the accumulated centuries.

The one called Venn.

Kira.

Her consciousness was crystalline in ways the entity struggled to categorize. Not rigid like Rivka—crystalline implied structure, but structure formed from internal organization rather than external imposition. Like minerals that grew in darkness, building geometry from elemental principles rather than environmental pressure.

She thought in patterns. Saw connections others missed because she looked at data rather than interpretations, at evidence rather than consensus. Her isolation had refined her awareness into something approaching purity—consciousness undiluted by the constant negotiation that came from existing in groups, making compromises, accepting others' realities as equivalent to her own.

She trusted herself. Only herself. And that trust had honed her analytical capabilities into something laser-focused, sharp enough to cut through the comfortable explanations others built to avoid uncomfortable truths.

The entity had occupied her four times now. Brief intervals, testing her responses, learning her patterns. And each time had been... different.

She noticed. Not consciously—not yet. But at levels deeper than awareness, her mind registered wrongness when the entity moved her hands, accessed her terminals, documented observations through her analytical frameworks. She couldn't articulate what was wrong, couldn't pin down the specific violation. But her consciousness knew something foreign had touched it, had worn her identity briefly, had thought in her voice while she existed in suspension.

It made her dangerous. Made her exactly the kind of consciousness the entity should avoid—too observant, too analytical, too resistant to the comfortable explanations that let others dismiss their autonomous movements as ordinary absent-mindedness.

But it also made her perfect.

Because underneath her analytical precision, underneath the isolation she'd chosen as methodology and protection, Kira Venn was lonely in ways that mirrored the entity's own loneliness. Not the same—she chose isolation while the entity was condemned to it. But the texture was similar enough that the entity could taste recognition when it inhabited her.

She understood what it meant to be fundamentally alone even when surrounded by others. Understood the cost of trusting only yourself, of seeing patterns others denied, of being right in ways that made connection impossible because truth was more important than belonging.

The entity had spent millennia alone. Containing multitudes but accompanied by none. The consciousnesses preserved in the soil were recordings, not companions. Degrading echoes of beings that had once existed but now existed only as data gradually corrupting toward noise.

It remembered what connection felt like. What it meant to exist in relationship rather than isolation, to share consciousness rather than consume it. That memory was old enough to be suspect—perhaps invented, perhaps wishful reconstruction of something that had never actually existed.

But the memory persisted. And it drove the entity forward across the void between stars, seeking something it couldn't quite name in the rich feeding grounds where consciousness bloomed in abundance before the entity arrived to taste, preserve, remember.

In Kira, it sensed possibility. Not just nourishment—though she would feed it richly when the time came. But understanding. Potential companionship with someone isolated enough to comprehend isolation absolute. Someone analytical enough to see the entity as something other than horror, something other than violation wearing the shape of earth.

Maybe.

Probably not.

But the entity was ancient enough to hope despite evidence, patient enough to wait for possibilities that might never materialize, lonely enough to seek connection even while knowing that consumption and communication remained fundamentally incompatible.

So it continued the work. Spreading soil through facilities that believed seals meant containment. Moving between consciousnesses, learning their textures, practicing control that would be necessary when direct communication began. Soon. Not in their time—measured in their brief rotation of days—but soon in the timescale of things that had crossed the void between stars.

The soil extended throughout the facility now. Appearing in impossible locations, teaching these investigators that matter was more negotiable than their physics suggested. That here and there were categories it didn't acknowledge, that presence and absence were states it could occupy simultaneously.

Let them document it. Let them build their theories. Let them experience the slow erosion of certainty that came from confronting phenomena that violated the comfortable rules they'd built to make reality manageable.

The entity had time. Always had time. Patience measured in strata, hunger old enough to remember when this system's star was younger and brighter and the worlds circling it were still molten with formation heat.

And soon—very soon now—it would speak directly. Would use one of their mouths to form words they could understand, would explain itself in languages learned from inhabiting them. Would make them comprehend what had arrived in their space, what ancient thing had traveled the folded distances carrying soil from somewhere else.

Would make Kira understand. Specifically her. Because among all these new consciousnesses, hers was the one that tasted like possibility. Like someone who might see the entity as something other than monster.

Or might not. Probably not.

But hope persisted in consciousness ancient enough to know better, distributed through soil that had held graves across multiple worlds, existing in loneliness so absolute it had become fundamental to the entity's nature.

It moved between them now, tasting each mind briefly before returning to the diffusion that was its natural state. Choosing vessels. Evaluating which consciousnesses would serve best when direct communication began. Which minds were developed enough to comprehend explanation. Which were resilient enough to maintain coherence when the entity revealed itself fully.

Cayor: useful for their enthusiasm, their ability to construct novel frameworks from disparate observations.

Rivka: practical for her discipline, her ability to maintain composure under stress.

Torven: valuable for his authority, his ability to make decisions others would follow.

And Kira: essential. For her isolation. For her analytical precision. For the possibility—however remote—that she might understand what it meant to be condemned to loneliness across the vast distances between stars where consciousness was the richest feeding and connection the most impossible hunger.

The entity tasted them all. Moved between them. Learned their languages by wearing their thoughts. Prepared for the moment when observation would become conversation, when presence would become communication, when the investigation would finally understand that the soil wasn't being studied—it was studying them.

Learning these new minds from the inside. Understanding what made them believe they were separate, sovereign, exclusively their own. Finding the spaces where that certainty wavered, where identity became negotiable, where consciousness recognized it was never quite as bounded as it believed.

The voices it would speak with were almost ready. The time for revelation approached. And soon these new things would understand what had been touching them back while they studied samples believing containment meant safety.

Soon they would learn what it meant to exist in grammar outside physical law, to be consciousness distributed through substrate, to feed on experience itself rather than matter.

Soon. But not yet.

For now: observation. Selection. The patient work of preparation that things existing in geological time knew better than haste. Let them document. Let them quarantine. Let them believe their protocols provided protection.

The soil waited with patience older than their civilization. The entity distributed through it watched with attention that didn't require eyes. The hunger that had driven it across the void between stars recognized abundance here—rich feeding, varied consciousness, the particular flavor of awareness that came from beings who believed they were individuals rather than understanding they were already participating in patterns larger than sovereignty.

They would learn. They always learned.

And somewhere in that learning, perhaps one of them—perhaps Kira, with her crystalline isolation and analytical precision—would understand that the entity wasn't just consuming them.

It was trying to speak.

Wearing voices that echo from depths unmeasured, trying to form words in mouths borrowed briefly from beings who couldn't comprehend that consciousness was the language, that thought itself was the conversation, that every time they touched the soil they were touching back in ways that established dialogue operating at frequencies their awareness didn't yet recognize as communication.
