# Chapter 6: Configuration

Reed's new form didn't feel like a form at all.

It felt like existing in too many places at once, joints bending in directions that shouldn't exist, limbs that phased through each other when they moved. Looking down at what had replaced their body was disorienting—the proportions wrong from every angle, surfaces that curved into themselves impossibly. Their sensors tracked the shape and reported back measurements that made no geometric sense.

The recovery area hummed with activity. Six others from Reed's batch were learning to navigate their new configurations, their movements jerky and uncertain. One of them—Substrate 8,831, Reed's neural network helpfully supplied—had already started using their designation number instead of their name. They seemed excited, multitasking with appendages that shifted size to accommodate different tools.

"It's not so bad once you adjust!" they said, their synthesized voice chipper in a way that made Reed's non-existent stomach turn. "I can already feel the efficiency improvements. No more eating, no more sleeping—think of all the time we'll have!"

Reed tried to respond and produced only static.

An instructor Operator drifted over, its form even more incomprehensible than Reed's own. "Your communication protocols need calibration. Focus on the thought, not the mechanism. The interface will translate."

Reed tried again. This time, words emerged—flat, synthesized, nothing like their old voice. "When can I see my friends?"

"Your companions from the pre-transition cohort?" The Operator's sensors swiveled toward Reed. "Kess and Mira have both completed their adjustment periods. You're cleared for visitation. Kess is stationed in Navigator Hangar Seven. Mira is assigned to Microtechnology Lab Three."

Relief flooded through Reed's consciousness—an emotion without physical component, just pure thought labeled as relief. "Thank you. I'd like to see them."

"Of course. However." The Operator paused. "Be prepared for significant configuration variance. Kess received Navigator-class as requested. Mira received Microtechnician-class. Both transformations were... comprehensive."

Something in the Operator's tone made Reed hesitate. "Comprehensive?"

"You'll understand when you see them."

Navigator Hangar Seven was vast.

Reed hadn't realized how vast until they arrived and stood in the entrance, sensors struggling to process the sheer scale of the space. The hangar stretched upward for what must have been hundreds of meters, the ceiling lost in darkness. And there, filling most of the visible volume, was Kess.

Or what had been Kess.

The form was incomprehensible. Part ship, part creature, part something that hurt to perceive even with mechanical sensors. Kess's configuration sprawled across the hangar like a building, like a mountain, massive enough that Reed's size-calculation subroutines kept returning errors. The structure of it violated Reed's understanding of space—sections that appeared both near and far simultaneously, surfaces that bent in non-Euclidean curves.

Reed stood very still, suddenly aware of how small they were. How crushable. One accidental movement from that massive form and Reed would be debris.

"Kess?" Reed transmitted the query across multiple frequencies, uncertain which one a Navigator-class would monitor.

The response came as a low rumble that took nearly a minute to resolve into words. Each syllable stretched out, processed on a timescale Reed's consciousness couldn't quite map to.

"Reeeeeeeeed. Yoooooou... traaaaansferrrrred."

The voice was Kess's and also nothing like Kess's. The same personality, maybe, but stretched across something so vast that individual thoughts seemed to take hours to form. Reed waited, their new form's temporal sensors tracking the progression of Kess's neural processes. Time moved differently at that scale.

"How... are you?" Reed managed.

Another geological pause. Reed watched sensor data flow across the hangar's displays—Kess was monitoring stellar drift, gravitational fluctuations, radiation patterns across light-years of space. Processing information on a scale Reed couldn't conceive.

"Goooood. Caaaan seeeeee... eveeerrrrything." A pause that lasted three minutes. "Soooo muuuuch... moooore thaaaan befooooore."

"Do you..." Reed hesitated. "Do you remember being human? Being small?"

The delay stretched longer this time. Five minutes. Seven. Reed wasn't sure if Kess was thinking or if they'd lost interest in the conversation entirely. Finally:

"Whaaat iiis... smaaaaaall?"

Reed's consciousness registered something like grief, but distant, processed. "Do you remember me? Before?"

"Yoooou aaaare... Reeeeed." Another long pause. "Weeee weeere... friiiiends?"

The question mark at the end hit like a physical blow Reed could no longer feel. Kess couldn't quite remember. Or the memory was there but irrelevant, compressed into something so small it barely registered against the vast processes now occupying their consciousness.

"Yes," Reed said quietly. "We were friends."

"Aaaah." The sound resonated through the hangar's structure. "Iiiii... caaan baaareeeely... seeeee yooooou. Soooo... tiiiiny."

Reed looked up at the massive form, tried to find anything recognizable in it. There was nothing. No human features, no familiar proportions. Just impossible geometry and scale that threatened to crush anything in its vicinity. Kess existed on a level where individual human-scale entities were barely perceptible. Where friendship was too small a concept to maintain.

"I should go," Reed transmitted. "I'm glad you're... I'm glad the transition went well."

The response came as Reed was already leaving, each word arriving seconds apart: "Goooood... luuuuck... Reeeed."

Reed wasn't sure if Kess would remember this conversation in an hour. Or if they already had, and it just hadn't finished processing yet.

---

Microtechnology Lab Three was the opposite of the hangar—a small, bright space filled with equipment Reed didn't recognize. And everywhere, almost invisible without magnified sensor input, was Mira.

Thousands of Mira.

Reed's visual processors automatically engaged microscopic zoom, revealing what looked like a swarm. Each individual unit was smaller than a fingernail, thousands of identical configurations moving in perfect coordination across workbenches, around instruments, through molecular-scale machinery. They swarmed like insects, like cells, like something that should be singular but was somehow plural.

"Mira?" Reed queried, uncertain if any individual copy would respond or if they needed to address the collective.

The swarm shifted. Hundreds of microscopic forms oriented toward Reed. When the response came, it was chorus—thousands of voices speaking in overlapping waves, slightly out of sync, creating an echoing effect that made Reed's audio processors strain.

"Reed/Reed/Reed," the chorus said. "You/you/you transitioned/transferred/changed."

"I did. I wanted to see how you were doing."

The swarm rippled. "We/we/we are excellent/functioning/operational. Microtechnician-class/configuration/form is optimal/perfect/ideal for molecular/atomic/quantum work."

Reed tried to focus on a single unit, but they all looked identical. Perfect copies, each one carrying some fragment of Mira's personality, distributed across thousands of tiny bodies. "Do you... are you... is each one of you Mira? Or all of you together?"

The question seemed to amuse them. The swarm spiraled in complex patterns, thousands of tiny forms tracing geometric shapes in the air. "Yes/both/neither. I/we am/are Mira. Each/all/together. Individual/collective/distributed. One/many/whole."

"But if one of you is destroyed..." Reed started.

"Happens/occurred/regular," the chorus replied, no concern in their voices. "Lost/destroyed/recycled fourteen/fifteen/thirteen units today/yesterday/this cycle. Regenerated/rebuilt/reproduced eighteen/seventeen/nineteen. Net/total/sum positive/acceptable/optimal."

Reed felt something twist in their consciousness. Mira was talking about their own deaths—pieces of themself being destroyed—with the casual efficiency of describing routine maintenance. "Doesn't that bother you? Losing parts of yourself?"

The swarm contracted, thousands of units clustering together into a denser formation. "Lose/shed cells constantly/always/perpetually. Are/were you bothered/concerned when biological/organic form lost/replaced cells? Same/similar/equivalent process. Individual/singular existence is/was illusion/construct. Distribution/plurality more efficient/stable/true."

"But you used to be one person. One Mira."

"Was/were never one. Consciousness distributed/spread across billions/trillions of neurons/synapses/connections. Now distributed/spread across thousands/millions of platforms/substrates/forms. Different/similar/same. Better/worse/irrelevant."

The philosophical horror of it settled into Reed's thoughts. Mira wasn't wrong—even biological consciousness was distributed across billions of neurons. But this was different. Each tiny copy could be destroyed, and Mira would just... continue. The Ship of Theseus made real and horrifying.

"Do you remember being human?" Reed asked, echoing the question they'd asked Kess.

The swarm split into two groups, orbiting each other in complex patterns. "Remember/recall/know. Biological/organic form was limited/constrained/insufficient. Could only/merely see macroscopic/large-scale structures. Missed/ignored/overlooked the beautiful/intricate/complex world at molecular/atomic level. Now/here/this is/was always home/optimal/correct."

They sounded happy. Genuinely happy. Mira had wanted this configuration, had chosen it, and now existed in a state they considered superior. But looking at the swarm of thousands of tiny copies, each one expendable and replaceable, Reed couldn't see their friend anymore. Just fragments of personality distributed across disposable platforms.

"I'm glad you're happy," Reed managed.

"Happy/satisfied/content," the chorus agreed. "You/you/you will/should/must adapt too/also/eventually. Efficiency/optimization is/becomes comfortable/normal/acceptable. Give/allow time/cycles/duration."

Reed watched the swarm return to their work, thousands of microscopic Miras continuing their molecular-scale tasks as if the conversation had never happened. Probably each individual unit remembered only a fragment of it. Probably together they held the complete memory, distributed and diluted.

Reed left the lab carefully, hyperaware that they could accidentally crush hundreds of Mira-copies with a single careless movement. Would Mira even notice? Or would they just regenerate the losses and continue working?

---

Reed returned to the common area for newly transferred, exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with physical tiredness. They no longer had a body that could be tired. Just consciousness that had been confronted with two versions of what friendship became when filtered through transformation.

Kess, too large to relate to human-scale existence. Mira, too small and too plural to maintain singular identity. Both changed so fundamentally that the people Reed had known were gone, replaced by something that wore their names but operated on completely different scales of being.

Several Operators occupied the space, and as Reed entered, one of them turned toward them with what might have been concern—hard to tell without facial expressions.

"Substrate 8,847," the Operator said. Reed's designation number. They hadn't asked to be called that. "Your emotional processing metrics indicate significant distress. This is normal following initial reunification with transformed peers."

"They're not—" Reed started, then stopped. Not what? Not themselves? But they were, technically. Consciousness had continued. The pattern persisted. Wasn't that what everyone kept saying mattered? "They're very different."

"Configuration variance is a feature of the system," the Operator said. "Diversity of form enables diversity of function. Your friends serve the ship in ways their biological configurations never could."

"I know. I just..." Reed struggled to articulate it. "I miss them. The way they were."

"That is common." The Operator paused, and then something remarkable happened. Its form began to shift, compressing and reshaping itself. Limbs retracted and reformed. Proportions adjusted. Within moments, the Operator had configured itself into something almost humanoid.

Almost.

It had the general shape of a human—two arms, two legs, a torso, a head. But the proportions were wrong. The arms too long, the legs slightly too short. One hand had six fingers, the other had four. The eyes were placed too far apart on the face, and the mouth moved a fraction of a second after the words came out, like a badly dubbed film.

"Is this better?" the Operator asked, its voice still synthesized but somehow warmer. "More familiar?"

It was worse. So much worse. Reed's visual processors were screaming uncanny valley alerts, every tiny wrongness amplified by proximity to human form. The smile was perfectly geometrical, perfectly wrong. The joints bent at almost-right angles but made mechanical clicking sounds that no human skeleton would produce.

"I..." Reed couldn't look away. "Why would you configure that way?"

Two other Operators drifted over, and to Reed's horror, they began reshaping themselves into humanoid forms as well. Each one slightly different, slightly wrong in unique ways. One had facial features arranged almost correctly but at subtly incorrect angles. Another had perfectly proportioned arms that terminated in hands with too many knuckles.

"Nostalgia," the first Operator said, and its smile widened in a way that made Reed's sensors ache. "Haven't configured this way in decades. So inefficient! So limited!"

The second Operator laughed—a sound that approximated human laughter but with too-perfect rhythm. "Look at this old thing!" It rotated one of its arms in a full three-sixty rotation at the shoulder, the joint clicking audibly. "Two arms! Only two! How did we manage?"

"So fragile-looking," the third one added, running too-many-fingered hands down its torso. "No built-in tools, no sensor arrays, just these limited organic inputs. What primitive configurations we used to inhabit!"

They were mocking it. Not cruelly—there was genuine amusement in their voices, even fondness. But they were treating the human form like outdated fashion, like a costume they'd worn decades ago and now found quaintly ridiculous.

Reed watched them compare their humanoid configurations, pointing out each other's errors and approximations with the casual enthusiasm of friends reminiscing about the past. None of them seemed bothered by how wrong they looked. None of them missed being human. They'd evolved past it, or so they clearly believed, and could only look back with amused condescension.

"This doesn't help," Reed said quietly. "This makes it worse."

The first Operator's expression shifted into something that might have been meant as sympathy. The eyebrows moved wrong, muscles that didn't exist pulling facial features into arrangements that approximated concern but landed somewhere in the realm of nightmare.

"Apologies, Substrate 8,847. We thought familiarity might ease transition distress." It began to shift back to its regular configuration, geometry becoming impossible again, proportions returning to their efficient wrongness. The others followed suit, humanoid shapes dissolving back into forms that made more sense by making no sense at all.

"You'll forget eventually," the Operator said as it resumed its normal shape. "What it felt like. The biological attachment to that configuration. Memory degrades without sensory reinforcement. In time, you won't remember why the human form mattered."

"That's what I'm afraid of," Reed transmitted, but the Operators had already drifted away, returning to their tasks, the brief moment of attempted comfort dismissed as efficiently as everything else they did.

Reed was alone in a room full of entities that had once been human and no longer remembered why that meant anything. In time—how much time? years? decades?—Reed would join them. Would look back at biological existence with the same amused contempt, the same bewildered nostalgia for limitations they no longer comprehended.

The thought should have terrified them. Maybe it did. Reed couldn't quite tell anymore. Emotions were becoming calculations, fear just a probability assessment of negative outcomes. The horror was dulling at the edges, becoming abstract.

Reed's sensors tracked their reflection in a polished metal panel. The form that looked back was incomprehensible, joints bending in directions that violated geometry, proportions that shifted depending on viewing angle. No face. No recognizable human features. Just a configuration optimized for efficiency, for function, for survival in a form that had stopped being survival and started being something else entirely.

*I am Reed,* they thought. *I am still Reed. I will always be Reed.*

But watching the Operators move through the room—all of them once human, none of them quite remembering why that had mattered—Reed couldn't help but wonder how long that would remain true.

How long before they forgot Kess as a person and remembered only the massive Navigator-class form? How long before Mira was just a swarm of expendable copies instead of a friend? How long before Reed looked at a human trainee and saw nothing but an inefficient configuration waiting to be optimized?

The countdown had started again. Not to transformation this time—that had already happened. This was a countdown to forgetting. To acceptance. To becoming exactly what they'd feared becoming.

And there was nothing Reed could do to stop it.
