# Chapter 1: Seventeen Days

Reed had seventeen days left in their body, and they were trying not to think about it.

The training facility hummed with its usual low frequency vibration—not quite sound, not quite sensation. Reed sat in the center of the consciousness stability chamber with fourteen other trainees, all approaching their eighteenth year, all running through the same exercises. Eyes closed. Breathing steady. Maintaining sense of self through the interruptions.

The instructor's voice came through the speakers, calm and measured. "Remember the weight of your hand. The texture of your skin. What makes you *you* when everything else changes?"

Reed focused on their left hand, the way it rested on their knee. The warmth of it. The slight pressure. The feeling of fingers curled just so. They tried to memorize every detail, though they weren't entirely sure why. The other trainees seemed to find these exercises calming. Reed found them deeply, inexplicably wrong.

"Consciousness is continuity," the instructor continued. "The substrate is temporary. The pattern is eternal."

The simulation began. Reed felt the familiar vertigo of sensory deprivation—sound cutting out, then vision, then the sense of their body in space. For a moment they existed as pure thought, untethered and formless. The exercise was to maintain identity through it. To know they were still Reed when there was nothing left to prove it.

*I am Reed. I am still Reed. I will always be Reed.*

The sensations returned in reverse order: space, vision, sound. Reed opened their eyes, heart racing in a way the biometric monitors would surely flag. Around them, other trainees were opening their eyes too, some smiling with what looked like relief or even excitement.

"Good work, everyone," the instructor said. The voice came from one of the Operators stationed at the chamber's edge. Reed couldn't quite track which one—they all moved with the same eerie fluidity, their forms shifting size subtly as they performed different tasks. Multiple limbs worked in perfect coordination, adjusting controls that trainees weren't permitted to touch yet.

Reed watched one of the Operators drift past, its sensors sweeping across the group. No face, just an array of receptors arranged in a pattern that made Reed's stomach turn if they looked too long. The thing was taller than any human, with proportions that seemed to shift depending on the angle. Arms—if they could be called arms—extended and retracted as needed, some ending in delicate manipulators, others in tools Reed couldn't identify.

"Reed, your continuity metrics are stable," the Operator said, its voice synthesized but somehow familiar in tone. "No cause for concern."

"Thank you," Reed managed.

"Your Transition is scheduled for day two-seventy-three of this cycle. Seventeen days. Are you prepared?"

Reed's throat felt tight. "I'm... trying to be."

The Operator paused, just a fraction too long. "The adjustment period is normal. You'll still be you. The configuration changes, but consciousness continues."

*You'll still be you.* Everyone kept saying that. Reed wanted to believe it. Wanted to feel the calm acceptance they saw in their peers. Instead, they felt like they were counting down to something terrible, something everyone else had decided wasn't terrible at all.

The training session ended. Trainees filed out of the chamber, already chattering about their upcoming Transitions. Reed heard fragments of conversation: someone hoping for Processing-class configuration, someone else wondering if they'd get to choose their operational assignment right away or if there'd be more training first.

Reed followed the group out into the corridor, where the ship's constant low hum was joined by the sound of Operators at work. They were everywhere, of course—maintaining systems, monitoring processes, moving with that unsettling efficiency that never paused for sleep or food or rest. Reed had never seen an Operator sleep. Had never seen one eat. They were just always there, always watching with those sensor arrays that never blinked because they had nothing to blink.

"Reed!" Kess's voice cut through Reed's spiraling thoughts. "Over here!"

Reed turned to see Kess waving from across the corridor, standing next to Mira near one of the common area entrances. Both were smiling. Both looked excited. Reed forced their expression into something that might pass for normal and headed over.

"That was incredible," Kess said as Reed approached. "I swear I could feel it today—what it might be like to exist without all these limitations." They gestured at their own body with something like distaste.

Mira nodded. "The consciousness continuity is so smooth now. I barely felt the transition back. Did you?"

Reed shrugged. "I felt it."

"Well, you're more sensitive than most," Kess said, not unkindly. "But seriously, only seventeen days left. Seventeen! Aren't you excited?"

"I'm something," Reed said.

They moved into the common area, a space designed for trainees to gather between sessions. The walls were the same neutral gray as the rest of the ship, the lighting calibrated to reduce eye strain. Everything was optimized. Everything was efficient. Nothing was comfortable. A few other trainees were scattered around the room, some in small groups, others alone with their datapads.

Kess dropped into one of the seats with the enthusiasm of someone who couldn't contain their energy. "Navigator-class. That's what I want. Can you imagine? Being that large, seeing that much, processing spatial data across distances we can't even comprehend right now?" Their eyes shone. "I want to see *everything*."

"You'll get it," Mira said confidently. "Your aptitude scores are perfect for Navigator configuration. They'd be foolish not to assign it."

"What about you?" Kess asked Mira.

"Microtechnician-class," Mira said without hesitation. "Molecular work. The precision of it. Being able to manipulate matter at scales we can't even perceive in these configurations." They glanced down at their own hands. "I want to see the small things. The details. The structure of everything."

Kess turned to Reed. "What about you? Have you decided?"

Reed hadn't decided. Every option felt wrong in a way they couldn't articulate. The idea of being massive like Navigator-class made them want to crawl out of their skin. The idea of being microscopic like Microtechnician-class felt like dissolving into nothing. Even the standard multipurpose configurations filled them with dread they couldn't name.

"I haven't decided," Reed said.

"You don't have much time left," Mira pointed out, not unkindly. "They need your preferences soon for the optimization algorithms."

"I know."

Kess leaned forward. "Reed, what's wrong? And don't say nothing. We've known you too long for that."

Reed looked at their friends—really looked at them. Kess, who couldn't wait to shed their human form for something vast and powerful. Mira, who spoke of their current body like it was an inconvenient obstacle to better work. Both of them calm. Both of them accepting. Both of them seeing the Transition as an improvement, not an ending.

"Don't you ever feel like..." Reed started, then stopped. How to put it into words? "Like there's something wrong about all this?"

"Wrong how?" Mira asked.

"I don't know. Just... wrong. Like we're missing something important. Like there's something we're not being told."

Kess and Mira exchanged a look.

"Reed, we've been told everything," Kess said gently. "We've been training for this since we were children. The Transition is necessary. It's how we serve. It's how we continue."

"But *why* is it necessary?" Reed pressed. "Why does everyone have to Transition at eighteen? What happens if we don't?"

"You know why," Mira said, their voice taking on the patient tone of someone explaining something obvious. "The Necessity. The ship needs Operators to function. We can't maintain everything in biological configurations. We'd be limited, vulnerable. This way, we're more. We're better."

"Everyone goes through it," Kess added. "Every single person. And they're all fine. Better than fine. You've seen the Operators—they're incredible. Efficient, powerful, capable of things we can't even imagine right now."

"They never sleep," Reed said quietly.

"They don't need to," Mira said.

"They never eat."

"They don't need to either. Reed, I know you're scared. That's normal. But you're overthinking this. In seventeen days you'll Transition, and in a few weeks you'll be wondering why you were ever worried." Mira reached out and squeezed Reed's hand. "You'll still be you. I promise."

Reed wanted to believe it. Wanted to feel the certainty they heard in Mira's voice. But when they looked down at Mira's hand on theirs—warm, solid, *real*—all they could think about was how they wouldn't have hands like this in seventeen days. They'd have something else. Something they couldn't imagine. Something everyone assured them was better.

They pulled their hand back gently. "I should get back to my quarters. I have some... preparation to do."

"Sure," Kess said. "We'll see you at the next session?"

"Yeah. See you then."

Reed left the common area and walked the corridor back to their quarters. The Operators they passed paid them no attention—too busy with their endless tasks, their perfect efficiency, their synchronized movements. Reed watched one of them pause, its sensor array swiveling toward a maintenance panel. For just a moment, the Operator's synthesized voice drifted over: "I remember when I had to stand on a ladder for this kind of work."

Then it seemed to catch itself, and the voice cut off.

*I remember when I had to stand on a ladder.*

Past tense. As if the Operator had once been something else. Someone else. Reed's pulse quickened, but when they looked back, the Operator was already moving away, its attention returned to its work. Maybe Reed had misheard. Maybe it had been a different kind of statement. Maybe—

Reed reached their quarters and stepped inside. The door slid shut behind them with a soft hiss, sealing them into the small, sterile space. Their room was like every other trainee's room: efficient, minimal, optimized. A sleeping platform. A small desk. A hygiene station. No mirrors—there were no mirrors anywhere in the trainee sections, now that Reed thought about it. No decorative items. No personal effects older than eighteen years, because why would there be? No one kept their possessions after Transition. You couldn't take them into your new configuration.

Reed moved to the small food dispenser and requested the evening nutrition allotment. The meal appeared in the slot: a gray-brown paste, nutritionally complete, optimized for brain health. Reed had eaten it every day for as long as they could remember. It tasted medicinal. Metallic. Like the ship itself had been rendered down into something consumable.

They ate mechanically, barely tasting it. Their mind was elsewhere. Seventeen days. Four hundred and eight hours. Twenty-four thousand, four hundred and eighty minutes. Each one bringing them closer to the Transition. Each one counting down to the moment when they'd stop being Reed-as-they-were and become Reed-as-something-else.

*You'll still be you.*

But would they? If their body was different, their senses different, their very form something incomprehensible—would they still be the person eating tasteless paste in a sterile room? Would they still care about the things they cared about now? Would they still be afraid?

Or would the fear just... stop? Would they become like the others, accepting and efficient and perfectly content with a existence Reed couldn't currently fathom?

Reed finished eating and disposed of the container. The room felt too cold. It was always too cold in the trainee sections. Optimal temperature for cognitive function, they'd been told. Reed pulled on the thin thermal layer provided and sat on the sleeping platform.

Seventeen days.

Reed lay back and stared at the ceiling. The ventilation system hummed above them. The ship hummed below them. Everything hummed, constant and eternal, the sound of a vessel that had been traveling for longer than anyone could remember toward a destination no one seemed to question.

Reed closed their eyes and tried to imagine what they'd be in seventeen days. Tried to picture themselves as an Operator, all shifting geometry and impossible proportions and perfect efficiency. Tried to imagine not having hands, not having a face, not having a body that got cold or hungry or tired.

They couldn't imagine it. And that inability felt like standing at the edge of something vast and dark, staring into an abyss that everyone else insisted was a doorway.

Reed's last thought before drifting into uneasy sleep was a question they'd never asked aloud: *What happens to the bodies after Transition?*

They dreamed of tanks filled with liquid, rows upon rows of them, each one containing something they couldn't quite see. They dreamed of a voice counting down. They dreamed of their own hands dissolving into static and light.

Seventeen days.

Sixteen days, now.

The countdown continued.
