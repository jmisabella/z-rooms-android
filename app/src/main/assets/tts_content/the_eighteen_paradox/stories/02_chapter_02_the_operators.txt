# Chapter 2: The Operators

Sixteen days left, and Reed was learning to look away.

The maintenance corridor stretched ahead, lit by strips of white light that made everything feel exposed. Reed's assignment for the morning cycle was simple: assist the Operators with routine calibration work on the environmental systems. Assist. As if Reed could do anything the Operators couldn't do better, faster, with appendages that could reach into spaces that shouldn't exist.

Three Operators were already at work when Reed arrived, their configurations adapted to the task. One had extended something like arms—though the joints bent in directions that made Reed's stomach tighten—into an open maintenance panel. Another had compressed itself to fit inside a narrow access shaft, its form rippling as it moved deeper into the wall. The third stood near the main console, its proportions almost human-sized, almost recognizable, except for the way its limbs seemed to occupy more space than they should.

"Good morning," that one said, its voice carrying a faint mechanical undertone that Reed had learned not to notice. "You'll be working with Operator Twelve-Seven today."

Reed nodded, not trusting their voice.

Operator Twelve-Seven was the one inside the wall. It emerged a moment later, unfolding from the access shaft in a way that shouldn't have been possible given the opening's dimensions. Its configuration was lean, multi-jointed, with too many articulation points along what might have been a spine. It turned toward Reed, and though it had nothing that resembled eyes, Reed felt seen.

"Thermal regulation needs checking," Twelve-Seven said. "You'll monitor the readouts. I'll handle the adjustments."

They worked in silence at first. Reed stood at the console, watching numbers shift as Twelve-Seven moved through the system, its form visible through transparent access panels as it navigated impossible spaces. The efficiency was remarkable. Every movement precise, every adjustment immediate. No wasted motion. No hesitation.

Too perfect.

Reed glanced down the corridor where the other two Operators worked. They moved in synchronization, reaching for tools at the exact same moment, adjusting their positions with identical timing. No communication that Reed could hear. No signals exchanged. Just perfect, seamless coordination.

"Temperature variance in section nine is higher than optimal," Reed said, reading from the display.

"Adjusting now," Twelve-Seven replied. Through the panel, Reed watched it extend something thin and precise into the wall's infrastructure. The temperature reading corrected instantly.

"How do you know where to—" Reed started, then stopped.

"Where to reach?" Twelve-Seven finished. "The systems are standardized. Once you know one ship, you know them all." A pause. "Besides, I've been doing this for a long time."

Reed wanted to ask how long, but didn't.

Another Operator arrived, its configuration towering and angular, with limbs that seemed to bend backward at the elbows—or what Reed thought were elbows. It nodded to Twelve-Seven, a gesture that looked almost normal until Reed noticed that its neck curved in a way no neck should curve.

"Needs extra reach on the upper conduits," the newcomer said. Then, without warning, its proportions shifted. Limbs extended, joints reconfigured, and suddenly it had the reach it needed. As casual as Reed might have rolled up their sleeves.

Reed looked away, focused on the console, tried not to think about what they'd just seen.

"You get used to it," Twelve-Seven said quietly. There was something in its voice that Reed couldn't identify. "The configurations, I mean. Once you've been through Transfer, changing configuration becomes as natural as breathing used to be."

Used to be.

Reed's hands stilled on the console.

"I remember—" Twelve-Seven continued, then stopped. A long pause. When it spoke again, the voice was different, more careful. "The training materials cover configuration flexibility. You'll understand after Transition."

But that wasn't what it had been about to say. Reed was certain of that.

The work continued. Reed watched the readings, called out values, tried to make themselves useful. Tried not to watch too closely when the Operators moved. Tried not to see the way one of them passed its appendage through another's workspace, the two forms occupying the same space for just a moment, overlapping in a way that made Reed's vision swim.

"Hand me the calibration tool," Twelve-Seven said.

Reed looked at the toolkit, found what they thought was the calibration tool—a small cylindrical device with sensor arrays—and held it out.

Twelve-Seven took it with something that couldn't be called fingers, holding the tool delicately despite the alien nature of its grip. "Thanks, Marcus."

Reed froze. "My name is Reed."

Twelve-Seven went completely still. The other Operators paused in their work, that too-perfect synchronization extending even to their stopping.

"Of course," Twelve-Seven said. "Reed. I apologize. A slip of the tongue."

But Reed had heard the certainty in that first name. Marcus. Said like Twelve-Seven knew them, remembered them, expected them to respond to it. Said like a name from muscle memory, from habit, from having said it many times before.

"Marcus was..." Reed started.

"A common name," Twelve-Seven said quickly. "I must have been thinking of someone else. The Transition can sometimes muddle recent memories and old ones. Nothing to worry about."

But Marcus wasn't a common name. Reed had never met another Marcus on the ship. And Twelve-Seven's voice had carried the inflection of familiarity, not confusion.

How old was Twelve-Seven? How many trainees had it worked with over the years? How many names did it remember, filed away in whatever served as its memory, fragments of people who had gone through Transfer and become Operators themselves, or been merged into the Amalgamation, or—

"We're finished here," one of the other Operators said, its voice breaking through Reed's spiraling thoughts. "Efficiency is optimal. Good work."

They left as smoothly as they'd worked, their movements coordinated in a way that spoke of consciousness beyond the individual. Twelve-Seven was the last to go, pausing at the corridor junction.

"You'll do fine," it said to Reed. "After Transfer. Everyone does."

Then it was gone, its form disappearing around the corner with impossible grace.

Reed stood alone in the corridor, hands shaking, staring at the console's readouts without seeing them.

---

The medical bay was the coldest place on the ship.

Reed had always thought that was intentional, a way to make the clinical nature of the space more obvious. White walls, white floors, white ceiling, all of it reflecting the harsh overhead lights. No warmth anywhere. No softness.

The Operator conducting Reed's examination had configured itself into something almost humanoid, perhaps thinking it would be more comfortable for the trainees. It wasn't. The proportions were close enough to human that the wrongness stood out sharper. Arms slightly too long, shoulders at an angle that wasn't quite right, head balanced on a neck that seemed both too thin and too flexible.

"Neural mapping looks excellent," the Operator said, gesturing to a display showing cross-sections of Reed's brain. The appendage it used to point was almost hand-shaped, but with too many joints in the fingers. "Consciousness continuity markers are well within optimal parameters."

Reed sat on the examination platform, sensors attached to their scalp, trying not to look at the Operator directly. "What about—"

"Physical metrics are not relevant for today's assessment," the Operator interrupted gently. Its voice had that same mechanical undertone, but softer, probably meant to be soothing. "We're focused on what matters. The brain. The self. Everything else is temporary."

Temporary. Reed's body was temporary. These hands, these eyes, this skin—all of it just borrowed space, counting down to obsolescence.

"I don't understand some of these readings," Reed said, looking at the brain scan. "What's the sensitivity threshold testing for?"

"Sensory deprivation tolerance," the Operator explained. Its head tilted in what might have been meant as a reassuring gesture but instead looked like its neck had come loose. "Transfer involves a brief period of adjustment. We need to ensure your consciousness can handle the transition between sensory inputs."

"What kind of adjustment?"

"Nothing to be concerned about." The Operator made a notation on a data pad, its too-jointed fingers moving across the surface with unsettling precision. "Some trainees report a moment of disorientation when consciousness settles into the new configuration. The brain adapts quickly."

A moment of disorientation. Reed wanted to ask what that meant, what it felt like, how long it lasted. But the Operator had already moved on, adjusting the sensors, bringing up new scans.

"Claustrophobia assessment is next," the Operator said. "Have you ever felt uncomfortable in enclosed spaces?"

"No."

"Good. What about heights? Vertigo? Spatial disorientation?"

"No."

"Excellent." Another notation. "Your consciousness profile suggests strong adaptability. You'll integrate smoothly."

Integrate. Not survive. Not endure. Integrate.

The door to the medical bay opened, and Kess walked in, grinning wide. "There you are! I thought I'd find you hiding in here."

Not hiding. Undergoing assessment. But Reed didn't correct them.

"Kess Marr," the Operator said, checking its schedule. "You're early."

"Couldn't wait," Kess said, bouncing slightly on their toes. They looked at the brain scans still displayed on the monitor, Reed's neural pathways rendered in false-color detail. "Wow, is that your brain? That's incredible. Look at all those connections!"

Reed looked. Saw themselves reduced to electrical patterns, chemical signals, data that could be mapped and measured and, presumably, transferred.

"Fifteen minutes until your slot," the Operator told Kess. "You can wait if you'd like."

Kess dropped onto the bench along the wall, still grinning. "Can't believe we're this close. Sixteen more days! Aren't you excited, Reed?"

The Operator's attention shifted to Reed, though it had nothing resembling eyes. Waiting for an answer.

"I'm..." Reed searched for a word that wouldn't be a lie. "Thinking about it a lot."

"I've been thinking about my configuration," Kess said, oblivious to Reed's careful phrasing. "Navigator-class gets to interface directly with the ship's systems. Can you imagine? Being able to feel the whole ship as if it's your body? Knowing every system, every corridor, everything all at once?"

The Operator made a sound that might have been approval. "Navigator-class configurations are particularly elegant. The integration of consciousness with shipboard systems creates a unique perspective."

"See?" Kess pointed at the Operator as if it had proven something. "Unique perspective. That's exactly what I want."

The door opened again, and Mira entered, carrying a data pad. They glanced at Kess, then at Reed, and sighed.

"You're early too," the Operator observed.

"Wanted to get it over with," Mira said, their practicality showing through as always. They sat next to Kess but with noticeably less enthusiasm. "How's your scan going, Reed?"

"Fine," Reed said. "Just measuring my brain."

"That's all that matters, right?" Mira's tone was matter-of-fact, but there was something underneath it. Resignation, maybe. Acceptance of something they didn't particularly want but saw no point in resisting. "Everything else is just temporary housing."

The Operator nodded, a gesture that looked more natural coming from it than its attempt at a reassuring head tilt. "Precisely. The consciousness is the individual. Configuration is simply the form that consciousness inhabits."

Simply.

Reed watched the Operator's too-long fingers adjust another sensor, watched the way its shoulder joint bent backward to reach a control panel that should have been out of reach. Watched and tried to imagine their consciousness inhabiting a form like that. Tried to imagine it being simple.

"All readings are optimal," the Operator announced. "You're cleared for Transition, Reed Talis. The procedure will proceed as scheduled in sixteen days."

Sixteen days.

"Congratulations," Kess said brightly.

The Operator removed the sensors from Reed's scalp, its appendages moving with clinical efficiency. Where its fingers touched Reed's skin, there was coldness. Not temperature cold—something else. An absence of something that should have been there.

"Next," the Operator said, and Kess jumped up eagerly, already pulling off their jacket to make the sensor placement easier.

Reed left the medical bay, Mira's quiet "see you later" following them into the corridor. Behind them, Reed could hear Kess chattering excitedly about Navigator configurations and system integration and the adventure of it all.

The door closed, muffling the sound.

Reed walked alone through white corridors, trying not to count down the days.

---

The observation deck was usually empty during the mid-cycle.

Most of the trainees avoided it. Too quiet, maybe. Too much empty space. Too stark a reminder that they were on a ship in the middle of nothing, traveling to somewhere none of them could clearly remember learning about, for reasons that had something to do with the Necessity but nothing to do with choice.

Reed came here specifically for the emptiness.

The viewport stretched across the entire forward wall, showing the star field beyond. Thousands of points of light, distant and cold. And between them, occasionally, the dark silhouettes of Operators working on the ship's exterior.

Reed watched one now, its form outlined against the void. It was massive out there, configuration adapted for the work, with appendages that seemed to sprout from no central body, reaching and grasping and manipulating in ways that made Reed's depth perception fail. It moved from one section of the hull to another without any visible means of propulsion, as if space itself was something it could navigate like walking.

Another Operator joined it, this one smaller, more compact, with symmetry that was almost beautiful until Reed tried to count the number of axes that symmetry operated on and felt dizzy.

They worked together with the same perfect coordination Reed had seen in the maintenance corridor. No communication. No visible signals. Just seamless cooperation, as if they shared one mind distributed across two configurations.

Maybe they did.

Reed pressed their forehead against the viewport, felt the cold of it against their skin. Out there, the Operators continued their work, moving across the hull with impossible grace, their forms breaking every rule of anatomy Reed had ever learned.

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

Reed jerked back from the viewport. An Operator stood a few meters away, its configuration humanoid-sized, though with proportions that suggested it could change that at will. Reed hadn't heard it enter. Hadn't heard anything at all.

"The view," the Operator clarified. "I've always thought it was beautiful."

"You come here often?" Reed's voice came out smaller than they'd intended.

"I used to." The Operator moved to the viewport, standing beside Reed. Close enough that Reed could see the fine details of its configuration—the seamless surface that had no visible joints but moved with perfect articulation anyway, the faint luminescence that might have been status indicators or might have been something else entirely. "Before. When I could feel the temperature through skin. When I could feel the vibration of the ship through my feet. It was... different then."

Reed's breath caught.

Before.

When I could feel the temperature through skin.

The Operator seemed to realize what it had said. Its form went very still, that perfect articulation freezing in place.

"You were..." Reed started.

"I've served for several cycles," the Operator said, its tone carefully neutral now. "One's memory sometimes conflates different periods of service. The sensory experience of configuration can create false memories of limitation."

"You said 'before,'" Reed pressed. "Before what?"

"Before is relative." The Operator stepped back from the viewport. "I should return to my duties. Enjoy the view, trainee."

"Wait—"

But the Operator was already leaving, its movement smooth and deliberate, not quite hurried but definitely retreating. The door slid shut behind it, leaving Reed alone with the stars and the questions multiplying in their mind.

When I could feel the temperature through skin.

Not 'if I could.' Not 'when one has skin.' When *I* could.

Past tense. Personal. Specific.

The Operator had been human once. Had stood here, maybe at this exact viewport, feeling the cold of the glass against their forehead, feeling the ship's vibration through their feet. Had felt things that could only be felt with skin, with nerves, with a body that was entirely their own.

And now it didn't. Now it had a configuration. Now it worked in the void without protection, moved without visible propulsion, coordinated with other Operators through means Reed didn't understand.

Now it had to be careful about using the wrong tense when talking to trainees who still had skin.

Reed looked back at the viewport. The Operators continued their work, dark shapes against darker space. How many of them remembered being human? How many of them still thought in terms of 'before' and 'after'? How many stood at this viewport during their off-cycles, if they had off-cycles, if they needed rest at all, and remembered what it felt like to be cold?

The ship hummed around them, that constant low vibration that was always present, always ignored. Reed pressed their hand against the wall, felt the vibration travel through their palm, up their arm, into their chest.

Sixteen days.

Sixteen days until they would go through Transfer. Until their consciousness would be moved into a configuration. Until they would become an Operator who had to be careful about verb tenses, who might someday stand at a viewport and accidentally tell a trainee about the ghost-memory of skin.

Sixteen days until 'before' became a real division in their life.

Reed stayed at the viewport for a long time, watching the Operators work, watching the stars burn in the distance. The ship carried them forward through the void, steady and inevitable, counting down whether Reed was ready or not.

In the reflection on the glass—faint, barely visible—Reed could see their own face. Still human. Still entirely theirs.

For sixteen more days.
