# Chapter 3: Preferences

Fifteen days left, and Reed was learning to remember what it felt like to forget.

The sensory deprivation chamber was smaller than the consciousness training room, designed for deeper work. Six trainees this time, all within days of their Transition, all seated in a circle with their eyes closed. The walls were padded in some material that absorbed sound completely. No echoes. No ambient hum from the ship. Just silence so thick it felt like drowning.

Operator-7731 stood at the center of the circle, its configuration tall and narrow, with sensor arrays that swept across the group in slow, regular patterns. Its voice came through speakers embedded in the ceiling, gentle and measured.

"Breathe in. Hold. Release."

Reed followed the instruction, though their heart was already beating too fast.

"Today we practice memory preservation," Operator-7731 continued. "The consciousness continuity during Transition is seamless, but the substrate changes. Your neural patterns will persist, but the context shifts. These exercises help anchor your sense of self to what matters: the pattern, not the medium."

Reed opened their eyes just enough to see the other trainees. All of them looked calm. One was even smiling slightly, like they were enjoying this.

"Close your eyes, Reed," Operator-7731 said, its sensors somehow detecting the slight movement. "Full sensory engagement requires isolation."

Reed closed their eyes.

"Remember the weight of your hand," Operator-7731's voice instructed. "The exact sensation of it resting against your leg. The warmth of blood flowing beneath skin. The texture of your own fingertips. Memorize this. Catalog it. Store it in detail."

Reed focused on their right hand where it rested on their knee. The slight pressure. The warmth. The way each finger curved naturally. They tried to hold onto every detail, to burn it into memory.

But why? Why would they need to remember what their hand felt like?

"Remember how your heart beats," the voice continued. "The rhythm of it. The feeling of your chest rising and falling with each breath. The sensation of lungs expanding. The weight of ribs protecting organs that will no longer need protection."

Will no longer need.

Reed's chest tightened. Around them, the other trainees breathed in perfect synchronization, calm and controlled. Reed's own breathing felt ragged by comparison.

"Remember the texture of your skin. The way temperature feels against it. Hot and cold. Rough and smooth. Pressure and release. All of these sensations are mappable, transferable, but the experience will differ. Store these memories now, while they're fresh."

While they're fresh. Before they're gone.

"Now," Operator-7731 said, "we begin the isolation sequence."

Without warning, the lights went out. Total darkness, so complete that Reed couldn't see their hand in front of their face. Then the temperature shifted, becoming perfectly neutral—not warm, not cold, just... nothing. The air itself seemed to disappear, leaving no sensation of movement or breath against skin.

Reed's breath caught in their throat.

"Continue breathing," Operator-7731's voice said, though now it seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere. "Focus inward. What makes you *you* when there is nothing external to define you?"

The silence deepened. Reed couldn't hear the other trainees breathing anymore. Couldn't hear anything. The darkness was absolute. The temperature null. No sense of the chair beneath them, no feeling of ground under their feet.

For a terrible moment, Reed didn't know where their body ended and the void began.

*I am Reed. I am still Reed.*

"Your body is not you," Operator-7731's voice intoned. "Your senses are not you. These are temporary interfaces. The consciousness persists. The pattern continues. What remains when everything else is stripped away?"

Reed wanted to scream. Wanted to stand up, run out, escape this exercise that felt less like preparation and more like practicing for death. But they couldn't tell where their legs were. Couldn't feel their hands to push off with. Couldn't sense anything except the growing panic in their chest—except was their chest even there anymore?

*I am Reed I am Reed I am Reed I am—*

"Hold that awareness," the voice said. "The 'I' that observes. The consciousness that persists. That is what transfers. That is what matters. Everything else is substrate."

The other trainees would be feeling this too, Reed knew. Experiencing the same sensory void. But they'd find it calming somehow. They'd embrace it as proof that they could exist without bodies, that consciousness could persist independent of physical form.

Reed just felt like they were dissolving.

The sensations returned gradually. First the temperature, creeping back to slightly-too-cold. Then the feeling of the chair, solid beneath them. Then sound—the quiet breathing of the other trainees, the faint hum of the ship's systems. Finally, light, dim at first, then slowly brightening.

Reed's eyes opened. Their hands were shaking.

Around the circle, the other trainees were opening their eyes too, looking peaceful. Centered. One of them sighed with what sounded like contentment.

"Excellent work," Operator-7731 said. "Your consciousness continuity metrics are all within optimal ranges. This kind of stability will serve you well during Transition."

A trainee across from Reed raised their hand. "That was incredible. I really felt it—the separation between self and body. Like I could exist anywhere."

"Precisely the insight we hope to cultivate," Operator-7731 said. "The substrate is temporary. The pattern is eternal. You will all carry this understanding through Transition and beyond."

Reed's stomach churned. The others were excited. Reassured. Prepared.

Reed felt like they'd just practiced dying.

---

The common area was crowded that evening, filled with trainees at various stages of their countdown. Some had weeks left. Others, like Reed, were in their final days. The conversation was loud, excited, focused on one thing: configuration preferences.

Reed sat with Kess and Mira at one of the corner tables, picking at a meal that tasted vaguely of nutrients and nothing else. The food on the ship was optimized for brain health—vitamins and compounds designed to keep neural tissue functioning at peak efficiency. It had always tasted medicinal. Reed used to not notice. Now every bite felt like a reminder that their body was just a temporary container for the only part of them that mattered.

"I heard they're looking for more Navigator-class assignments," a trainee at the next table was saying. "Something about expanding the exploration range."

"Lucky," someone else replied. "I'd take Navigator over Processing any day. Imagine seeing the universe at that scale."

Kess leaned forward, unable to contain their enthusiasm. "See? I told you Navigator was the right choice. They need people who can think in spatial dimensions we can't even perceive right now." They turned to Reed. "You should request it too. We could work together."

Reed pushed their food around their plate. "I don't think I'd be good at it."

"You'd be good at anything," Mira said. "Your aptitude scores are high across the board. You could choose any configuration."

"That's the problem," Reed said quietly. "I don't want any of them."

Kess and Mira exchanged another one of those looks. The kind that said they were worried about Reed but didn't know what to do about it.

Three more trainees joined their table, carrying their own trays of flavorless nutrition. Reed recognized them from various training sessions: Paige, who was aiming for Processing-class; Loren, who wanted Maintenance like Reed was supposed to want; and someone whose name Reed couldn't remember, quiet and nervous-looking.

"We're talking configurations," Kess announced. "What's everyone hoping for?"

"Processing-class," Paige said immediately. "Direct integration with the ship's computational network. Can you imagine having that much processing power? Being able to run calculations that would take years in biological configuration?"

"You'll barely be individual anymore," the quiet trainee said. "Processing-class configurations are almost entirely networked."

"That's the point," Paige said. "Efficiency. Why limit yourself to one isolated consciousness when you could be part of something larger?"

Reed's hands tightened around their utensils. "Don't you want to stay yourself?"

"I'll still be myself," Paige said. "Just... more. Better. More efficient."

"Maintenance-class for me," Loren said. "Versatile, adaptable, can handle a variety of tasks. Seems like the most practical choice. You get to stay relatively—" They paused, searching for the word. "—compact? Human-scale, mostly. Well, until reassignment anyway."

"Reassignment?" Reed asked.

"After a few years you can request different configurations if needed," Mira explained. "Depends on ship needs and your performance metrics. It's all very flexible."

"And then after your second contribution, it doesn't matter anyway," Paige added casually, taking a bite of their meal.

The table went quiet.

Reed's voice came out smaller than intended. "Second contribution?"

Paige looked up, surprised. "You know. Later. When you join the Amalgamation."

"The what?"

Now everyone was staring at Reed.

"The Amalgamation," Mira said slowly. "You must have heard about it. It's part of the standard orientation materials."

Reed's heart was pounding. "Tell me anyway."

Kess shifted uncomfortably. "It's... after you've served in operational configuration for a while. Decades, usually. Your consciousness merges with the collective. You become part of the Amalgamation. It's—"

"It's an honor," Paige interrupted. "A second contribution to the ship. Your individual service ends, but you become part of something greater. The Amalgamation manages ship systems, processes historical data, maintains the collective consciousness. It's basically transcendence."

The quiet trainee spoke up. "My instructor said it's like... letting go of the burden of self. Becoming part of the larger whole."

Reed felt cold. Colder than the ship's ambient temperature. "But what happens to you? To your individual consciousness?"

"It persists," Mira said, though their voice carried a hint of uncertainty. "In a sense. As part of the collective."

"In what sense?"

"Reed." Kess put their hand over Reed's. "You're overthinking this. The second contribution is decades away. Let's focus on getting through the first one, okay? One step at a time."

"But I want to understand—"

"There's nothing to understand," Paige said, not unkindly. "It's just how it works. Everyone goes through Transition. Everyone serves. Everyone contributes. It's the cycle. It's the Necessity."

That word again. The Necessity. The vague, unquestioned reason for everything.

"Why is it necessary?" Reed asked. "What exactly are we protecting against? What requires all of this?"

The table went quiet again, but this time the silence felt different. Uncomfortable. Like Reed had asked something inappropriate.

"Reed," Mira said gently. "Are you okay? You've been really anxious about all of this, and it's... it's starting to worry us."

"I'm fine," Reed lied. "I'm just trying to understand."

"We all understand," Loren said. "We've been trained for this our entire lives. The ship needs Operators. Biological configurations are too limited, too fragile. We can do more, be more, in operational form. It's better for everyone."

"Better," Reed repeated. The word felt hollow.

"You'll see," Kess said, squeezing Reed's hand. "In fifteen days you'll go through Transition, and in a few weeks you'll wonder why you were ever scared. Right?"

The others at the table nodded, their expressions earnest and reassuring.

Reed looked at their faces—Kess, Mira, Paige, Loren, the quiet trainee whose name they still couldn't remember. All of them calm. All of them accepting. All of them ready to have their consciousness ripped from their bodies and transferred into machines, to serve for decades, and then to be absorbed into some collective that may or may not preserve individual awareness.

All of them fine with it.

Reed was the only one who saw the horror.

"Yeah," Reed said quietly. "Right."

---

The library terminal was in one of the quieter sections of the ship, a small room with a few database access points for trainees who wanted to research or study. Reed had never been much of a student before, had never felt the need to dig deeper into the materials provided. Everything they needed to know was in the training sessions, or so they'd been told.

But now Reed needed answers.

They sat down at one of the terminals and pulled up the search interface. The screen glowed in the dim light, waiting.

Reed typed: *Transition process details*

The results populated instantly. Clinical documents, training materials, consciousness continuity studies. Reed opened the first one.

*The Transition process ensures seamless consciousness transfer from biological substrate to operational configuration. Neural patterns are mapped with 99.97% fidelity, maintaining continuity of self while enabling enhanced capabilities. The preservation process safeguards biological substrate for optimal longevity and resource efficiency.*

It was the same language from every training session. Smooth. Reassuring. Empty.

Reed tried another search: *Why is Transition necessary*

More results. More clinical language.

*Operational efficiency requires enhanced capabilities beyond biological limitations. The Necessity mandates optimal resource utilization for ship survival and mission continuity.*

The Necessity. Always capitalized. Always vague.

Reed leaned back, frustration building. Every document said the same thing in slightly different words. Consciousness continuity. Operational efficiency. The Necessity. Resource optimization.

But none of them explained what it *felt* like. None of them addressed whether you were still you afterward. None of them explained what the Amalgamation actually was, or what happened to individual consciousness when it "merged with the collective."

Reed's fingers hovered over the keyboard, then typed: *Preservation substrate maintenance*

They weren't sure why they searched for that. Just a feeling. A hunch from the earlier conversation with Operator Twelve-Seven, from the medical examination's focus on brain health, from the way everything treated the body as temporary.

The results were different this time. Technical documents. Maintenance protocols. System logs.

Reed opened one of the logs at random.

*Cycle 4,891, Day 156: Tank 4,782 - nutrient flush required. Circulation pump replacement scheduled. Substrate neural activity nominal.*

Reed stared at the text.

Tank. Substrate. Neural activity.

They opened another log.

*Cycle 4,891, Day 157: Tank 3,391 - replaced circulation pump. Temperature regulation adjusted. Substrate 3,391 showing optimal preservation metrics.*

Another.

*Cycle 4,891, Day 159: Tanks 8,000-8,100 - routine neural monitoring complete. All substrates within acceptable parameters. Tank 8,047 flagged for enhanced nutrient supplementation.*

Reed's breath came faster.

These weren't abstract technical documents. These were maintenance records. Regular, routine maintenance of thousands of... what? Tanks containing substrates with neural activity.

Substrates. That's what the medical Operator had called Reed's body. The temporary interface. The biological substrate.

Reed scrolled through the logs. Hundreds of entries. Thousands. Different cycle numbers going back years, all with the same routine maintenance tasks.

Nutrient flush.
Temperature regulation.
Circulation pump maintenance.
Neural activity monitoring.

All of it describing tanks. Numbered tanks. Tens of thousands of them.

Reed's hands were shaking as they searched deeper, following cross-references in the maintenance logs. They found an inventory document.

*Preservation Facility Status Report - Cycle 4,891*
*Total active preservation tanks: 47,392*
*Substrates in optimal condition: 47,385*
*Substrates requiring maintenance: 7*
*Substrates scheduled for recycling: 12*

Forty-seven thousand tanks.

Forty-seven thousand biological substrates being preserved, maintained like equipment, monitored for neural activity.

Forty-seven thousand brains in tanks.

The realization hit Reed like a physical blow.

The bodies didn't come along during Transition. The consciousness was transferred, yes, but the brain stayed behind. Removed from the body. Placed in preservation. Kept alive in tanks. Maintained like any other ship system.

Thousands of them. Tens of thousands.

All the people who had gone through Transition. Their brains were still here. Still alive. Still generating neural activity. But separated from consciousness, from awareness, from everything that made them *them*.

Or were they? Was consciousness really transferred, or just copied? Was the brain in the tank still aware somehow, trapped without sensory input? Or was it just biological machinery, running on automatic while the real person existed somewhere else in machine form?

Reed didn't know. Couldn't know.

But they knew this: in fifteen days, their brain would be removed from their body. Placed in a tank. Given a number. Maintained with routine nutrient flushes and circulation pump replacements.

Their body would be discarded. Recycled, probably, like the maintenance logs mentioned.

And something—someone—would wake up in a machine configuration, believing themselves to be Reed, carrying Reed's memories and thoughts and fears.

But would it be Reed? Or just a copy, while the real Reed's brain pulsed with meaningless neural activity in tank number whatever-came-next?

The terminal screen blurred as Reed's eyes lost focus. The maintenance logs scrolled past, endless entries of routine procedures on substrates that used to be people.

Thirteen days left.

Thirteen days until Reed's brain joined the thousands in preservation.

Thirteen days until Reed stopped being Reed, or became Reed somewhere else, or split into two Reeds with no way to know which one was real.

Thirteen days until everything Reed feared became inevitable, unavoidable, certain.

Reed sat in the dim light of the terminal room, staring at maintenance logs, counting down.

The ship hummed around them, constant and cold.

Somewhere in its depths, forty-seven thousand tanks pulsed with life that had no name.

Soon there would be forty-seven thousand and one.
