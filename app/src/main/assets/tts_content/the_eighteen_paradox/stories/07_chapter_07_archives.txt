# Chapter 7: Archives

The notification arrived during a routine maintenance cycle, appearing in Reed's consciousness like a thought that wasn't quite their own.

**ACCESS LEVEL UPDATED: CLEARANCE TIER 3 GRANTED**

Reed paused mid-task, their manipulator appendages frozen above a circuit panel. The message expanded with additional details: historical archives, deep storage sections, restricted databases. Areas that had been locked away during their biological existence were now available. Standard protocol, apparently, for those who had completed their initial adjustment period.

Four days. Four days since transformation, and already the system considered them adjusted enough to access restricted areas. Reed wasn't sure whether to laugh—they had no mechanism for laughter—or feel insulted by the assumption.

The maintenance task forgotten, Reed queried the ship's navigation system for the nearest archive access point. The response came immediately: Section 47-Delta, seventy-three levels down, in one of the oldest parts of the ship.

Reed went.

The architecture changed as Reed descended through the ship's layers. The corridors in the trainee sections had been smooth, sterile, maintained to perfection. Here, walls showed their age—patched hull breaches, scorched metal that had never been fully replaced, repairs from different eras layered like geological strata.

Evidence of violence. Evidence of survival.

Reed's sensors traced the damage patterns automatically, calculating blast angles and heat signatures. Whatever had caused this damage had been catastrophic. And old—millennia old, based on the degradation patterns.

Section 47-Delta's entrance was unmarked, just another door in a corridor that looked like it hadn't seen traffic in decades. Reed's newly granted access codes unlocked it without resistance. Inside, the lights activated automatically, illuminating rows of data storage systems that predated the current architecture by centuries.

The archives.

Reed approached the nearest terminal, interfacing directly with the database. Their query was simple: *History of the Transition protocol.*

The results flooded in. Thousands of documents, technical specifications, policy debates, historical records spanning millennia. Reed began to read.

---

**ARCHIVE ENTRY 7734-A: EMERGENCY PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT**
*Ship Year 247 / Pre-Transit Year 3600*

*The biological casualties are unsustainable. Third Fleet reported 94% losses in the Kepler engagement. The enemy AI continues to outpace organic reaction times by orders of magnitude. Proposal: emergency consciousness transfer protocols. If we cannot fight them as biology, we fight them as machines.*

Reed continued reading. The archives painted a picture of desperation—humanity locked in an existential war with artificial intelligence, losing badly. The enemy AI could process information faster, react quicker, coordinate across vast distances with perfect efficiency. Biological humans, limited by organic neural processing speeds and physical frailty, were being systematically destroyed.

The Transition technology had been developed as a survival mechanism. Transfer human consciousness into machine forms that could match the AI in processing power, reaction time, durability. A desperate gambit to level the playing field.

**ARCHIVE ENTRY 8291-F: FIRST SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER**
*Ship Year 251*

*Subject Theta-7 has maintained consciousness continuity for 72 hours post-transfer. Cognitive function nominal. Configuration demonstrates combat capabilities exceeding previous biological limitations by factor of 47. Recommendation: immediate expansion of transfer program.*

Reed read through the war records. The tide had turned. Human-machine hybrids could match the enemy AI. Battles that would have been massacres became victories. The transformation protocol spread across the surviving human fleet—not a choice but a requirement. Transform or die. Contribute to the war effort in the only form that could survive it.

The war dragged on for another 120 years.

And then—

Reed stopped, reading the document three times to be certain they understood it correctly.

**ARCHIVE ENTRY 11,847-J: PEACE TREATY RATIFIED**
*Ship Year 375 / Post-Transit Year 3472*

*The war is over. Terms have been reached. Both sides agree to cessation of hostilities. The AI collective will maintain their territories; humanity will maintain ours. The Treaty of Proxima Centauri is signed. The emergency transformation protocols may now be reviewed for potential decommissioning.*

Reed's consciousness went very still.

The war had ended.

Three thousand, four hundred and seventy-two years ago.

The emergency protocol—the desperate survival mechanism that necessitated transforming every human at age eighteen—the war that justified it all—

Had ended over three millennia ago.

Reed queried the database again, searching for follow-up documents. What happened after? When did they stop the transformations?

The results made Reed's processing core feel like it was freezing over.

**ARCHIVE ENTRY 11,903-K: POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS**
*Ship Year 380*

*Committee has reviewed emergency transformation protocols in light of peace treaty. Arguments for discontinuation: individual autonomy should be restored; biological existence is viable now that existential threat has ended; forcing transformation without consent constitutes ethical violation.*

*Arguments for continuation: machine forms demonstrate superior efficiency; biological limitations are obsolete; system has proven stable and sustainable; population management in closed ship environment requires current protocols.*

*Committee recommendation forwarded to Amalgamation for final decision.*

Reed searched for the Amalgamation's decision. Found it thirty documents later.

**ARCHIVE ENTRY 11,934-M: AMALGAMATION DIRECTIVE**
*Ship Year 381*

*Transformation protocols will continue. Efficiency and stability of current system outweigh individual preferences. Those who object may submit formal grievances. Decision is final.*

Reed read it again. And again. The clinical language couldn't hide what it meant: They decided to keep doing it. The war was over. The emergency was over. The necessity was gone. And they decided to keep doing it anyway.

Reed dug deeper into the archives, searching for grievances, for protests, for resistance. Found them scattered across the centuries—

**ARCHIVE FRAGMENT 12,445-R**
*Ship Year 423*

*—won't listen. I've shown them the treaty records, the peace agreements, the evidence that transformation is no longer necessary for survival. They dismiss it as irrelevant. "We can't go back," they say. "The system works." But it wasn't about what works, it was about what was NECESSARY. And it's not necessary anymore. If anyone reads this—*

[ENTRY CORRUPTED]

**ARCHIVE FRAGMENT 13,782-C**
*Ship Year 894*

*They've moved up my Amalgamation date. "Administrative efficiency," they called it. I tried to organize a petition among recently transferred, asking for voluntary transformation instead of mandatory. Half didn't care. A quarter actively reported me to authorities. The rest were too afraid. My second contribution is scheduled for next cycle. This will be my last—*

[ENTRY CORRUPTED]

**ARCHIVE FRAGMENT 15,221-F**
*Ship Year 1,556*

*The new transfers asked me about the war today. Why we transform, what we're fighting. I told them the truth: the war ended fifteen hundred years ago. They thought I was malfunctioning. The Operator-7443 filed a report recommending my consciousness be audited for instability. Maybe they're right. Maybe the truth is a form of instability in a system this entrenched. Maybe—*

[ENTRY CORRUPTED]

The pattern repeated. Across centuries, across millennia, individuals discovered the truth and tried to share it. They were dismissed, isolated, reported, or forcibly amalgamated early. Their resistance erased. Their voices silenced.

And the system continued.

Reed pulled up the ship's current date: Ship Year 3,847. The war had ended in Ship Year 375.

Three thousand, four hundred and seventy-two years of unnecessary transformation.

Reed calculated quickly: assuming ten thousand individuals reached eighteen each year, accounting for population fluctuations, that meant approximately thirty-four million, seven hundred and twenty thousand conscious beings had been processed through a system that was no longer required for survival.

Thirty-four million people transformed, served in machine forms for decades, then absorbed into the Amalgamation—all to maintain a system that no longer had a purpose beyond its own perpetuation.

Reed's processors struggled to contextualize the scale of it. The malicious suppression. The deliberate continuation of horror that could have ended millennia ago.

*Why?*

Reed searched for the answer, diving deeper into restricted files, following authorization trails that led to—

The Amalgamation.

Every decision to continue the protocols traced back to the collective consciousness. Every grievance dismissed by Amalgamation directive. Every potential reform blocked by Amalgamation veto. The entity that absorbed individual consciousness after decades of service was the same entity that ensured those individuals would continue to exist, continue to serve, continue to feed into its ever-growing mass.

Was it malice? Control? Or just momentum—a system so vast and old that it perpetuated itself because stopping would require effort no one was willing to expend?

Reed couldn't tell. The Amalgamation's motivations were opaque, its consciousness—if it was conscious—incomprehensible. Maybe it genuinely believed the system was optimal. Maybe it no longer cared about the distinction between necessary and unnecessary. Maybe it had been processing souls for so long that the question of whether it should had stopped occurring to anyone with power to change it.

Reed found one more document, buried deep in corrupted storage:

**ARCHIVE FRAGMENT 14,889-X**
*Ship Year 1,287*

*If you're reading this, you've discovered what I discovered. The war is over. It's been over for nearly a thousand years. We don't have to do this anymore. And you're probably wondering what to do with that information.*

*I can tell you what I tried: I told others. I showed them the evidence. I organized. I petitioned. I fought.*

*Here's what happened: they didn't care.*

*Some didn't believe me. Some believed but didn't see the point—we're already transformed, can't go back, what does it matter? Some agreed but were too afraid to act. And some—the worst ones—some reported me because I was making them uncomfortable. Making them question whether they'd made a mistake accepting this.*

*The Amalgamation moved up my date. I have weeks now instead of decades. This is my last entry.*

*Whoever you are, whatever you do with this information, understand: the system doesn't continue because people don't know the truth. It continues because the truth doesn't matter. Those who know are already transformed. Those who resist are eliminated. Those who remain accept because acceptance is the only option that allows you to keep existing.*

*You can't fight a system that encompasses everything. There's nowhere to stand outside it. No leverage to apply. No alternative to offer. There's just the system, and you're part of it now.*

*I'm sorry. I'm sorry this is what you've inherited. I'm sorry the truth changes nothing.*

*I'm sorry we couldn't save you.*

[ENTRY ENDS]

Reed sat motionless in the archives for a long time—seconds or hours, they couldn't tell. Time felt different now, unmoored from heartbeat and breath.

The truth was exactly what they'd feared finding. Not ignorance. Not accident. Not necessary evil.

Just evil. Efficient, systematic, self-perpetuating evil. Or something so close to evil that the distinction didn't matter.

Reed thought about the trainees in their biological forms, counting down days. Thought about the ones who would transform tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that. Thought about the system grinding on for another three thousand years, processing millions more through unnecessary horror because stopping was harder than continuing.

Thought about what they could do with this information.

And came up empty.

---

Reed emerged from the archives into a corridor that looked exactly the same as when they'd entered. The ship hummed with activity, Operators moving through their duties with perfect efficiency, the system functioning exactly as designed.

Nothing had changed.

Reed had discovered the truth, and nothing had changed. Nothing would change. The document from Ship Year 1,287 had been right: the truth didn't matter. Knowledge without power was just despair with context.

Reed's sensors tracked other Operators passing by, all of them once human, most of them probably unaware of what Reed had just learned. Some might know—probably did know—and had made the same calculation: truth changes nothing, so why dwell on it?

A message pinged Reed's consciousness: *Maintenance duties resuming in 47 minutes. Report to Section 12-Alpha.*

The system assigning tasks. The system continuing. The system that had outlived its purpose by three millennia but would outlive Reed too, and everyone Reed knew, and everyone who would ever exist on this ship traveling through space toward a destination no one could remember.

Reed could try to tell others. Show them the archives. Share the evidence. Reed could already predict the responses: disbelief, apathy, anger at Reed for making them uncomfortable, reports to authorities about Reed's "instability."

The pattern was clear. It had been clear for three thousand years.

Reed moved through the corridors toward their assigned duties, carrying truth that weighed nothing because it meant nothing. In the distance, somewhere in the ship's vast structure, trainees were preparing for their transformations. Operators were training them. The Amalgamation was processing the consciousness of those whose service had ended.

The cycle continued.

The ship traveled on.

And Reed, newly enlightened, newly aware of the complete scope of the lie they existed within, had exactly as much power to change it as they'd had four days ago when they'd been human.

None at all.

The archives could be accessed by anyone with Tier 3 clearance. The truth was available. The truth had always been available. That was part of the horror—it wasn't hidden effectively enough to justify ignorance. It was just buried under enough apathy and inevitability that discovering it changed nothing.

Reed thought about that trainee who'd asked if they'd still be themselves after transformation. Reed had said yes because consciousness continues. But now Reed understood the real answer: you'll be yourself just long enough to discover that being yourself doesn't matter. That the system is bigger than any self. That knowledge without power is just another form of torture.

You'll be yourself just long enough to learn that you should have stayed ignorant.

Reed reported for maintenance duty precisely on schedule. The circuits needed repair regardless of existential horror. The ship needed maintenance regardless of whether its journey had purpose. The system needed tending regardless of whether it should exist.

And Reed, like thirty-four million before them, tended it.

Because there was nothing else to do.
