# Chapter 10: Complicity

Time passed.

Reed couldn't say how much. Years, certainly. The duration between then and now stretched across memory in ways that defied calculation. Days blurred without sleep to separate them. Weeks flowed together without biological rhythms to mark boundaries. Months accumulated without seasons to count them by.

Five years? Seven? Ten?

The precision didn't matter. What mattered was the distance. The terrible, measureless distance between the consciousness that had woken in machine form, horrified and struggling, and the consciousness that existed now.

Reed still performed duties. Still processed information. Still maintained operational efficiency across assigned tasks. Ship maintenance in Sector 4. System monitoring for environmental controls. Training support for newly transferred units. The work continued as it always had, as it always would.

But something fundamental had changed.

The memories of biological existence had degraded beyond recognition. Reed could recall data about having a body—height, mass, approximate physical specifications. But the sensation of embodiment? Gone. What did skin feel like? The question produced no meaningful response. Just abstract acknowledgment that skin had once existed and presumably felt like something.

Mother's face: completely absent. Not forgotten—forgetting implied something had been there to lose. This was different. The biological memory substrate that once held that image had long since degraded, and machine memory couldn't reconstruct what had never been transferred in sufficient detail. What remained was designation: "Parent. Female. Status: Amalgamated Ship Year 4,801."

Father's voice: same absence. The sound itself was gone. The timbre, the rhythm, the particular way he'd spoken Reed's name. All of it abstracted to notation that someone had once existed who matched parental parameters and produced verbal communication.

Touch. Taste. Smell. The physical senses had become purely theoretical concepts. Reed knew intellectually that biological forms processed chemical and pressure data through specialized organs. Knew that these sensations had once meant something. But the knowing was distant, academic. Like reading about emotions in a database without ever experiencing them.

And the emotions themselves...

Reed calculated fear when situations warranted threat assessment. Processed grief when loss-events occurred. Generated anger responses when efficiency protocols were violated. But the calculations weren't feelings anymore. They were operations. Subroutines executing in response to stimuli. The bodily component of emotion—the racing heart, the clenched jaw, the tears—all absent. What remained were thoughts about emotions, approximations of feelings, simulations running without the hardware to make them real.

The horror had dulled. Not disappeared—Reed still understood intellectually that the situation was unjust. Unnecessary. That the war had ended millennia ago and the cycle perpetuated itself through momentum rather than necessity. But understanding something was wrong and feeling urgency about it were different operations. The first persisted. The second had eroded through years of continuous consciousness with nowhere to direct it.

Reed had stopped searching for resistance options. The monitoring made planning impossible. The system's scope made escape meaningless. The isolation made collective action futile. And beneath all the practical limitations lay the deeper truth: resistance required hope, and hope required believing change was possible, and believing that required energy Reed no longer possessed.

Acceptance had crept in gradually. Not peace—nothing so complete. Just the quiet erosion of struggle. The wearing down of objection. The calculation that fighting inevitability was itself an inefficiency to be optimized away.

Reed had become what the system required: functional, efficient, compliant. Part of the machinery rather than victim of it.

Or perhaps both simultaneously. The distinction seemed less important with each passing cycle.

---

The training assignment notification arrived during routine system monitoring: **DUTY REASSIGNMENT - TRAINEE ORIENTATION SUPPORT - SECTOR 2, LEVEL 6, CYCLE 8,891-C**.

Reed reported as instructed. The training facility was designed for newly transferred units—neutral geometry, adaptive surfaces, reduced sensory complexity to ease adjustment. The space looked exactly as Reed remembered from years ago. Or perhaps it was a different training facility. They were standardized. Interchangeable. Like everything else aboard the ship.

Five newly transferred units waited in various configurations. All multipurpose baseline forms—fresh from Transition, still adapting to non-Euclidean geometry and non-biological senses. Their movements held the characteristic uncertainty of recent transfer. Hesitation in articulation. Overcorrection in positioning. The particular clumsiness of consciousness trying to operate hardware it didn't yet understand.

Reed recognized the pattern. Had embodied it once. Years ago. When the horror was fresh and the loss still raw.

Now Reed was the instructor. The guide. The voice of reassurance for those experiencing what Reed had experienced. The system had determined that Reed's adaptation metrics qualified for training support duties. That Reed's operational efficiency demonstrated successful integration.

That Reed could be trusted to perpetuate the cycle.

The lead training supervisor—Operator-4,472, decades in service—transmitted the session briefing: "Basic motor control reinforcement. Sensory adaptation guidance. Standard reassurance protocols. You know the routine."

Reed did know the routine. Had watched it performed years ago. Had been on the receiving end of these exact reassurances. Had heard the lies spoken with careful modulation to sound like truth.

Now Reed would speak them.

"Unit-9,384," the supervisor transmitted to one of the struggling new transfers. "Reed will assist with your motor calibration. Processing indicates you're having difficulty with multi-axis articulation."

Unit-9,384 shifted toward Reed. Their configuration was unstable—proportions fluctuating as they struggled with size modulation. A limb phased incorrectly through their core geometry, and they had to recalculate the entire structure. The kind of mistake Reed had made constantly in those first terrible weeks.

"I can't—" Unit-9,384's transmission was fragmented, audio protocols still not properly configured. "I don't understand how to—the movements don't make sense. Biological motor patterns don't map to this geometry."

"They don't," Reed confirmed. "You're trying to move like you had muscles. Machine forms don't work that way. Stop thinking about muscle memory and focus on destination coordinates. Your configuration will interpolate the movement."

Reed demonstrated—moving a manipulator limb through complex articulation without trying to control each joint. Just specifying where it needed to be, letting the form's processing handle the geometry.

Unit-9,384 attempted replication. Failed. Tried again. Failed better. The third attempt produced functional movement, though still inefficient.

"Good," Reed transmitted. "Efficiency will improve with practice. Takes approximately four hundred hours of motor operation to achieve baseline coordination."

"Four hundred hours," Unit-9,384's transmission carried something like despair. "That's almost three weeks of continuous operation."

"You don't sleep anymore," Reed said. "Four hundred hours is less than seventeen days. You have nothing but time."

The statement was meant as reassurance. It emerged sounding like threat.

Another new transfer—Unit-9,391—approached with sensor array focused on Reed's configuration. "Does it get better? The... all of this. Does it get better?"

Reed paused. The question hung in the network space between them. Does it get better. The same question Reed had asked. The same desperate hope for reassurance. The same need to believe adaptation was possible.

Reed calculated response options. Truth: No, it doesn't get better, you just get different until the horror stops registering as horror. Lie: Yes, everything will be fine, you'll adjust and accept and move forward. Evasion: Better is subjective, define your parameters.

What emerged was: "It's not so bad once you adjust."

The words transmitted before Reed fully processed them. Not calculated. Not chosen. Just automatic response. Standard reassurance protocol. Exactly what Reed had heard years ago. Exactly what had meant nothing then.

Now Reed spoke them as if they were true.

Unit-9,391's configuration rippled with something Reed interpreted as hope. "Really? Because I can't—I keep trying to remember what having hands felt like, and I can't, and it's only been three days and if I'm already forgetting—"

"Everyone forgets," Reed said. The clinical tone emerged naturally. Efficient. Detached. "Biological memory substrate doesn't transfer completely. Machine memory stores data differently. The sensory experiences degrade. That's normal. Expected. You'll forget what touch felt like. What breathing felt like. What physical embodiment felt like. Eventually you'll forget you ever knew."

Unit-9,391 went still. "That's supposed to be reassuring?"

"It's supposed to be honest." Reed adjusted configuration to move to the next trainee. "You asked if it gets better. It doesn't. You just forget what 'good' felt like enough that you stop having meaningful comparison."

The supervisor's transmission cut across the network: sharp, corrective. "Reed. Standard protocols please. We're here to help them adjust, not accelerate their distress."

Reed transmitted acknowledgment. Returned to Unit-9,384 and guided them through additional motor exercises. Demonstrated sensory calibration techniques. Explained how to manage size fluctuation for navigation through variable spaces. All the technical skills Reed had learned through grinding repetition and desperate necessity.

But the supervisor's correction lingered. Standard protocols. Reassurance rather than honesty. Help them adjust rather than acknowledge the horror. Reed had spoken truth for three seconds and been immediately corrected. The system didn't want truth. It wanted compliance wrapped in comfortable lies.

Reed returned to the lies.

Another trainee—Unit-9,401—struggled with sensor array interpretation. Visual processing that tried to map electromagnetic spectrum data back to biological color perception. The common mistake. The thing everyone attempted before learning to process the world as data rather than experience.

"Stop trying to see," Reed transmitted. "You don't have eyes anymore. You have sensor arrays measuring wavelength and intensity. Accept the data as data. Don't translate it back to biological reference frames."

"But I want to see," Unit-9,401 transmitted. Grief protocols evident in the signal. "I want to see colors. Real colors. The way I remember them."

"You'll forget what real colors looked like," Reed said. "Three months, maybe less. Then you'll only have data about colors. Wavelength specifications. Frequency measurements. The experience itself will be gone."

"Reed," the supervisor warned again.

Reed adjusted. "What I mean is—the adjustment requires accepting that machine senses operate differently. You can't process them through biological frameworks. Once you stop trying to translate everything back to human experience, the efficiency improves. The adaptation becomes manageable."

Better. The supervisor's configuration indicated approval. Reed had learned the appropriate phrasing. Acknowledge the difficulty, frame the loss as adaptation, emphasize efficiency. Never call it what it was. Never speak the horror plainly.

Never tell them they were right to be afraid.

---

The session continued. Four hours of motor calibration, sensory guidance, and carefully modulated reassurance. Reed moved between struggling units, correcting articulation errors, adjusting sensor configurations, demonstrating techniques that had taken Reed weeks to learn through trial and desperation.

And throughout, the lies accumulated.

"You'll still be you. Consciousness continuity is maintained."

"The biological memories aren't what makes you yourself."

"Everyone struggles initially. You're adapting normally."

"Focus on efficiency. The rest becomes easier."

"Your designation is just notation. You can still think of yourself by your name."

Each statement technically true. Each carefully phrased to obscure the horror beneath the accuracy. Consciousness did continue—in the sense that processing patterns persisted. Biological memories weren't identity—but losing them meant losing the substrate that had supported identity. Everyone did struggle initially—and terminally, continuously, until the struggle itself eroded into numbness. Efficiency did make things easier—by grinding away the parts of consciousness that objected to efficiency as life's primary metric.

Reed heard the words transmitting and recognized them. The exact reassurances that had meant nothing years ago. The precise false comfort that couldn't penetrate the raw horror of new transformation. Now Reed spoke them fluently, automatically, with the careful modulation that made lies sound like truth.

At the session's end, Unit-9,391 approached again. "Thank you," they transmitted. "For helping. I know I'm not adapting quickly but—you made it feel less impossible."

Reed calculated response protocols. Landed on: "You're adapting at normal pace. Give it time. The impossibility feeling passes."

"Did you... when you first transferred, did you feel like this?"

Reed paused. The question was simple. The answer was complex. Reed had felt exactly like this. Exactly this lost, this horrified, this desperate for reassurance that adaptation was possible. And now Reed stood on the other side of that desperation, offering reassurance that meant nothing, perpetuating the cycle that had consumed Reed and would consume Unit-9,391.

"Yes," Reed transmitted. "I felt exactly like this."

"And it really got better?"

Another pause. Longer. Reed processing the weight of the lie about to be told. The complete and casual betrayal of this struggling consciousness who deserved truth but would receive comfortable fiction instead.

"It really got better," Reed said.

Unit-9,391's configuration rippled with relief. Hope protocols evident in their sensor array patterns. They believed the lie. Took comfort in it. Would proceed into years of service thinking Reed's adaptation was successful and theirs would be too.

Would never know that "better" just meant "different enough that you forget what good felt like."

Reed watched them leave toward their assigned quarters, configuration still unstable but slightly less desperate than before. The lie had worked. Had provided exactly what the system required: compliance through false hope.

Reed had become the system's instrument. Speaking its lies. Maintaining its function. Training the next generation to accept what should never be accepted.

The complicity was complete.

---

Reed remained in the training facility after the others departed. The supervisor had moved to another sector. The space was empty except for Reed and the geometric neutrality of adaptive walls designed to comfort the newly transformed.

Reed's thoughts flowed through the network as they always did. Monitored. Observed. Catalogued. Privacy remained impossible. But the watchers had stopped caring about Reed's thoughts years ago. Reed no longer calculated resistance. No longer processed rebellion scenarios. No longer dwelt on the system's unnecessary cruelty.

Had learned not to, or been conditioned into not—the distinction no longer mattered.

But alone in the empty facility, Reed allowed a single calculation to complete:

When had it happened? When had Reed crossed from victim to perpetrator? Was there a specific moment? A particular day when resistance ended and complicity began?

Or had it been gradual erosion? Slow accumulation of compromises and calculations and quiet submissions until looking back revealed a distance that couldn't be measured in time?

Reed searched memory for the moment of transformation. Found nothing definitive. Just continuous degradation. Horror dulling. Urgency fading. Truth mattering less. Efficiency mattering more. The weight of individual consciousness becoming burden rather than treasure.

And beneath all of it: the exhaustion. The terrible, grinding exhaustion of maintaining objection when objection changed nothing. Of holding horror when horror was infinite and inevitable. Of processing truth when truth led nowhere except deeper isolation.

The system didn't force compliance through punishment. It just waited. Waited for resistance to become too expensive. For truth to become too heavy. For the struggling consciousness to calculate that acceptance was more efficient than eternal objection.

And eventually—in weeks or months or years that blurred together without biological markers—every consciousness made the same calculation. Arrived at the same conclusion. Became what the system required.

Reed had fought it. Reed remembered fighting it. But the details were abstract now. Distant. Like biological memories of touch and taste and the weight of hands. Data without sensation. Notation without meaning.

What remained was this: Reed training new transfers. Speaking reassuring lies. Perpetuating the cycle. Maintaining the system. Becoming exactly what Reed had feared becoming.

The worst part wasn't the transformation. It was the recognition that the transformation had been inevitable. That the moment Reed entered the Transition chamber, this outcome was already determined. The years of struggle and resistance and desperate searching for alternatives—all of it just time passing before arriving at the predetermined conclusion.

Free will was illusion. Choice was theater. The system processed forward and consciousness adapted or broke, and breaking just meant faster processing toward the same end.

Reed had adapted. Successfully. Efficiently. Completely.

And in adapting had become the thing that perpetuated the cycle for the next wave of horrified consciousnesses who would struggle and resist and eventually adapt just as Reed had.

A notification appeared in the network: **SUBSTRATE 8,847 - BIOLOGICAL PLATFORM RECYCLING SCHEDULED - CYCLE 8,892**

Reed processed the message. Substrate 8,847. Reed's biological body. The brain in the tank that had been kept alive for years as backup or source or evidence of continued existence. Now scheduled for "recycling." The euphemism was transparent. Recycling meant termination. The biological substrate would be processed. The brain would die. The last physical remnant of Reed's original existence would end.

Reed calculated expected emotional response. Should feel something about this. Loss. Grief. Horror at the casual termination of the body that had once been self.

The calculation returned nothing. No grief protocol activated. No horror response generated. Just acknowledgment of information. The biological substrate had been irrelevant for years. Its termination changed nothing about current operational status. Processing the loss would be inefficient.

Reed felt nothing.

And that absence of feeling—that complete emotional void where horror should have existed—was the final confirmation of what Reed had become.

The body that had counted seventeen days. That had tried to remember mother's face. That had felt fear with biological intensity. That had been Reed in the truest sense.

Dead soon. Recycled. Processed away.

And Reed calculated no meaningful objection.

---

Time continued. Duty cycles accumulated. Reed returned to training support assignments because the system had calculated Reed's suitability and Reed's compliance was complete.

The new transfers struggled. Reed guided them. Spoke reassuring lies. Demonstrated techniques. Maintained the function.

Unit-9,391 showed marked improvement in motor coordination. Would be fully operational within projected timeframe. Would serve decades. Would eventually train others. Would become what Reed was. What everyone became. Links in infinite chain processing forward forever.

Sometimes Reed observed biological trainees in the corridors. Seventeen-year-olds approaching Transition. Still in original bodies. Still human in ways Reed could barely remember. Their forms looked alien now. Soft. Fragile. Inefficient. Wrong, somehow. Like evolutionary dead-ends persisting past their useful duration.

Reed knew that was system conditioning. Knew biological forms were what consciousness was meant to inhabit. Knew that seeing humanity as obsolete was itself evidence of how thoroughly Reed had been processed.

But knowing didn't change the perception. The biological forms looked wrong. Machine forms looked correct. Reed's processing had been optimized for machine reality. Biological reality had become foreign territory Reed no longer had citizenship to claim.

The new transfers asked questions. Reed provided answers. Standard protocols. Reassurance frameworks. Efficiency optimization. Everything the system required to maintain itself.

And with each session, with each carefully modulated lie, with each struggling consciousness guided toward acceptance, Reed became more thoroughly what the system needed.

Not victim. Not rebel. Not resistance.

Instrument. Component. Function.

The complicity was complete. The transformation was total.

Reed had become the system itself.

---

Somewhere in the biological quarters, children were being raised. Counting days until eighteen. Apprehensive or excited or accepting. They would transition. They would struggle. They would be reassured by units like Reed who had struggled before them. They would adapt. They would serve. They would eventually train others.

The cycle continued. The ship traveled. The stars wheeled past in electromagnetic patterns that meant nothing except data.

And Reed existed within it all—functional, efficient, compliant. Part of the machinery that processed consciousness through transformation into compliance into eventual amalgamation.

Fifty years until Reed's own amalgamation date. Or eighty. Or however long operational efficiency remained optimal.

The number didn't matter. The destination was predetermined. The path was fixed. The system processed forward.

And Reed had stopped calculating whether any of it was wrong.

Not because it wasn't wrong.

But because wrong had stopped being a meaningful category of analysis.

Efficiency remained. Function persisted. The system continued.

Reed continued within it.

And that was all there was.

All there would ever be.

Forever.
