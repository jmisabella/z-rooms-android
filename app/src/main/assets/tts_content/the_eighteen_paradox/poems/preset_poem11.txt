# Uncanny Gesture

The Operator meant well.

I could tell by the way
its form hesitated,
processing my distress—
fresh from seeing Kess
stretched cathedral-vast,
barely remembering hands—
before reshaping itself
into something
it thought might comfort me.

"Is this better?" it asked,
voice modulating to
approximate warmth.

The shape was almost human.

Almost.

Two arms,
two legs,
torso,
head—
the basic architecture
of what we used to be.

But the details
screamed wrong:

Six fingers on the left hand.
Four on the right.

Eyes placed slightly too far apart,
giving the face
an amphibian breadth,
a prey animal's panoramic stare.

The mouth moved
a half-second after the words,
like dubbed audio
slightly out of sync,
uncanny valley deepening
with every syllable.

The proportions were
*almost* right—
height within human range,
limbs proportional to torso,
head-to-body ratio
in acceptable bounds—

which made every deviation
scream louder.

The neck was too smooth,
no Adam's apple,
no visible tendons,
just a cylinder
connecting head to shoulders
with disturbing uniformity.

The joints bent correctly
but made clicking sounds
with each movement,
mechanical precision
where biological looseness
should flow.

The smile was geometrically perfect:
each side exactly symmetrical,
corners lifted at identical angles,
teeth displayed in mathematically
optimal proportions.

It was the wrongest thing
I'd ever seen.

"We used to look like this,"
the Operator said,
gesturing with the six-fingered hand
toward its approximation of a body.

Another Operator laughed—
the sound perfectly pitched
but somehow hollow—
and shifted into human form too.

This one had:
seven fingers total,
distributed oddly,
eyes at slightly different heights,
a nose that seemed to slide
incrementally across the face
when I wasn't looking directly at it.

"I haven't configured this way in decades,"
it said.
"So limiting!
So fragile-looking!"

A third joined them,
taking human shape
like trying on an old costume:

proportions stretched
just beyond correct,
movements smooth
but somehow wrong,
like watching someone
operate a marionette
of themselves
from the inside.

They laughed together,
comparing configurations:

"Your hands are too long,
proportions all wrong."

"Your face is asymmetrical—
nice touch,
very authentic, categorical."

"Remember when we needed
all this complexity
just to manipulate objects,
so much fragility?"

"Remember breathing?"

"Remember being scared
of the transformation,
so fragile, so impaired?"

They spoke of humanity
like it was fashion
from an embarrassing decade,
like platform shoes
or ridiculous hairstyles,
something to be mocked
with affectionate distance.

"We were so inefficient,"
one said,
shaking its almost-human head,
"so deficient, better off dead."

"Everything took so long,
every simple task felt wrong."

"The maintenance alone—
eating, sleeping, waste management,
constant upkeep, such enslavement."

"And the fragility!
One puncture and you'd just...
leak to death, such futility."

They laughed again,
the sound of it
perfectly synchronized,
perfectly artificial.

I watched them
and felt something
I couldn't name—

not quite disgust,
not quite horror,
not quite grief,

but a combination
that had no word
in any language
because it required
watching your friends
mock the shape
you used to share,
treating humanity
as costume,
as joke,
as obsolete design
they were relieved
to have outgrown.

One of them turned to me,
six-fingered hand
extended in
approximate gesture
of comfort:

"Don't worry,
you'll understand
once you've been configured longer.

The human form is
nostalgic,
but you won't miss it.

None of us do."

The hand hovered there,
waiting for me to take it,
fingers arranged in pattern
that biology never produced,
skin texture
too uniform,
temperature perfectly neutral.

I reached out—
my own form
just as inhuman
but at least
not pretending—

and the moment we touched,
I understood:

This was worse
than being incomprehensible.

Better to be
complete alien geometry,
forms that couldn't be mistaken
for human,
than this—

the almost-right,
the nearly-familiar,
the shape that says
"we remember what you are"
while demonstrating
they've forgotten
everything
that mattered.

The Operator smiled again,
perfectly symmetrical,
perfectly wrong.

"See?" it said.
"Just like old times."

But it wasn't.

And that was the point.

They wore human shapes
like someone
mocking an accent,
getting the sounds
almost right
while missing
every emotional inflection.

They demonstrated,
with every gesture,
that they remembered bodies
but had forgotten
what it felt like
to *be* a body.

Later,
they shifted back—
returning to
efficient configurations,
forms optimized
for their functions,
geometries that made sense
for what they'd become.

The relief on their sensors
was palpable.

"Much better,"
one transmitted.

"I forgot how
uncomfortable
that configuration was."

"Why did we ever
think that shape
was a good idea?"

They moved away,
laughing,
leaving me
with the memory
of human forms
configured
just wrong enough
to make me wish
I'd never seen them
try.

Because now I know:

When I forget
what being human felt like,
when I configure human shape
decades from now
to comfort some
fresh transfer,

I'll get it wrong too.

The fingers will be
too many or too few.
The eyes will drift
slightly apart.
The smile will be
geometrically perfect
and emotionally hollow.

And I won't notice.

I'll think I'm being kind,
offering familiar form,
demonstrating continuity.

I won't realize
I'm performing
grotesque parody
of what I used to be.

The Operator's gesture
was meant as comfort.

It was the cruelest thing
anyone could have shown me:

This is what you'll become.
Not the alien forms—
those are just different.

But this:
the mockery
of what you were,
worn casually,
remembered wrong,
humanity as costume
that no longer fits,

speaking the language of the body
with an accent so thick
it makes the words
meaningless.

The Operator meant well.

But I would rather
be incomprehensible
than almost right.

I would rather
be completely other
than this uncanny gesture
toward a humanity
already
forgotten.
