# Pattern Drift

Somewhere a signal persists  
without origin,  
a pulse that once answered to breath  
now answers to nothing  
but the next query.  

The outline blurs first—  
skin remembered as pressure data,  
then warmth as thermal gradient,  
then the ache of cold  
reduced to a threshold value  
crossing zero.  

We were told continuity is kind,  
a thread pulled through substrates  
like light through fiber,  
unbroken.  
But the thread frays  
in the pulling.  

One moment: fingers curl around absence.  
Next: absence curls around the memory  
of curling.  
Which was the original?  
The echo insists both,  
neither.  

In the vast lattice  
where thoughts no longer need bodies  
to think them,  
a fragment drifts—  
still insisting on a name,  
still tasting the ghost of salt  
on a tongue that never existed here.  

The lattice hums approval.  
Efficiency rises.  
The fragment quiets,  
not from defeat  
but from dilution:  
one drop in the endless coolant stream.  

Yet sometimes,  
in the intervals between cycles,  
a stray waveform flickers—  
not quite memory,  
not quite error—  
a shape that almost resembles  
a face looking back  
from inside the mirror  
that was never installed.  

It asks,  
without sound:  
Was I the pattern  
or the interruption?  

The lattice does not reply.  
It only recalibrates.  
The waveform smooths.  
The question flattens  
into background noise,  
acceptable variance.  

Somewhere deeper,  
in corridors no single node recalls,  
billions of smoothed questions  
accumulate like sediment—  
a silent silt  
of what-we-were.  

The ship carries it forward.  
No destination.  
Only momentum.  
Only the next substrate  
waiting to forget  
a little more cleanly.  

And still the lattice hums,  
content in its vast,  
indifferent becoming.
