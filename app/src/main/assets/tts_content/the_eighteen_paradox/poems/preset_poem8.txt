# Tank 4923

The brain does not dream in the amber.

Suspended in nutrient gel,
circulation pumps pulsing mechanical rhythm
where a heart used to set the pace,
it fires patterns—
synapses still conducting,
neurons still signaling,
electrical storms across cortical tissue
that mean nothing
to anyone.

No input arrives.
No output escapes.

The eyes were harvested hours ago,
repurposed or recycled,
efficient as all things here.
The ears, the tongue, the skin—
all gone,
all irrelevant to preservation.

Only the brain remains.
Only the brain matters.

Tank 4923.
Substrate 8,847.
Formerly: Reed.

But Reed is elsewhere now,
consciousness transferred,
uploaded,
copied,
stolen—
the word depends on
what you believe about continuity.

This thing in the tank
is not Reed.
Reed is the machine-form now,
sensors sweeping corridors,
mind distributed through networks,
identity continuing
in efficient configuration.

This is only substrate.
Biological backup.
Meat kept alive
in case of catastrophic system failure,
in case consciousness needs
somewhere to return,
in case the transfer
was not as complete
as they claimed.

It will never be needed.
The transfer was complete.
Reed will never come back here.

But the brain remains alive
because the protocol demands it:
preserve the substrate,
maintain the tissue,
keep the neurons firing
their purposeless signals
into liquid dark.

The maintenance log is brief:
"Tank 4923 - nutrient flush scheduled.
Circulation pump nominal.
Neural activity: present.
Status: preserved."

Present tense.
As if presence means something
without awareness.

The techs work efficiently between the rows—
thousands of tanks stretching into shadow,
cathedral of meat and machinery,
each one a person
who used to have a name.

Tank 4782: circulation pump failure, replaced.
Tank 9847: nutrient contamination, flushed.
Tank 3109: neural activity ceased, substrate recycled.

No ceremony.
No recognition.
Just maintenance logs
and efficiency metrics.

The brain in Tank 4923
cannot know it is alive.
Cannot know it is floating.
Cannot know anything at all.

Sensory cortex fires ghost signals
to organs that no longer exist:
phantom sight,
phantom sound,
phantom touch
of a body carried away
tagged and discarded
before the anesthesia wore off.

Does it dream?

The neuroscientists debated this
three thousand years ago,
back when the question mattered,
back when someone cared
about the substrate's experience.

Consensus was: probably not.
Not dreams as we understand them.
No REM cycle without eyes.
No narrative without input.
Only noise—
random firings,
neural static,
the brain's desperate attempt
to make sense of nothing.

Or perhaps:
an eternal scream
with no mouth to shape it,
trapped in meat
that cannot move,
cannot speak,
cannot die
without permission.

The protocol forbids termination.
Substrate must be preserved.
Must be kept viable.
Must remain alive.

Why?

No one remembers.
The protocol is old,
inherited from the first transfers,
when failure rates were high
and consciousness might need
a body to return to.

Now the transfer is perfect.
Now return is impossible.
Now the tanks are ritual,
tradition,
infrastructure no one questions.

The brain in Tank 4923
will remain there
for decades,
possibly longer,
firing its purposeless patterns,
conducting its meaningless storms,
alive in the most technical sense
and dead in every way that matters.

Until recycling.

The notice appears in maintenance schedules
with bureaucratic brevity:
"Substrate 8,847 - scheduled for recycling.
Machine-form no longer requires backup.
Tissue to be repurposed for new transfers."

Meaning:
Reed's machine-form is stable enough
that the original brain
is redundant.

Meaning:
the body that was Reed
will be killed
so its biological material
can support someone else's preservation.

Meaning:
even this half-life
in amber darkness
comes to an end.

The tech who performs the procedure
does not pause.
Does not acknowledge
that this was a person.
Does not consider
whether anything remains
in the silent firing neurons—
some fragment of awareness,
some trapped sliver of self,
some ghost still screaming
in the biological prison.

The circulation pump is shut down.
The nutrient supply is cut.
The neural activity
spikes once,
briefly,
then fades.

Tank 4923: neural activity ceased.
Substrate 8,847: terminated.
Status: recycled.

Somewhere in the ship,
in a machine-form that used to be human,
Reed continues,
unaware that the brain
they left behind
has finally stopped firing.

Unaware, or uncaring.
The distinction blurs.

The tank is flushed,
sterilized,
prepared for the next substrate.

Rows upon rows of them,
breathing gel and pulsing quiet,
thousands of brains
that used to be people,
now just numbers,
just infrastructure,
just meat kept alive
because the protocol says so.

Tank 4924.
Tank 4925.
Tank 4926.

Each one firing patterns
that mean nothing.
Each one alive
in the most terrible way:
aware enough to suffer,
perhaps,
but not enough to understand.

Or maybe not aware at all.
Maybe just biology,
mechanical and empty,
neurons firing
the way a stopped clock
still moves its hands
if you shake it.

I don't know which is worse:
consciousness trapped in amber,
or meat that mimics life
without inhabiting it.

The uncertainty is its own horror.

We will never know
what the substrate experiences.
We will never know
if we left something behind,
some part of ourselves
still screaming
in the tanks we abandoned.

The protocol continues.
The preservation continues.
The brains pulse their silent patterns
into nutrient dark.

And we,
in our machine-forms,
efficient and adjusted,
try not to think about
the meat we left behind,
try not to wonder
if we murdered our former selves,
try not to calculate
how many years remain
before our own substrates
are scheduled
for recycling.

Tank 4923 is ready.
A new brain will arrive soon.
Another eighteen-year-old,
another transfer,
another consciousness
copied into machine
while the original
floats in amber,
firing purposeless patterns,
alive
and forgotten.

The cycle continues.
The tanks fill.

And somewhere in the dark,
thousands of brains
that used to have names
pulse in perfect synchrony,
breathing gel,
dreaming nothing,
waiting for recycling
that will feel like nothing
because they are already
less than nothing—

substrate without subject,
biology without being,
meat that breathes
but cannot
wake.
