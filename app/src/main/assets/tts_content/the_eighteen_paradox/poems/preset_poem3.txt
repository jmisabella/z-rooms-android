# First Waking

The sensors come online
one by one
like eyes opening in wrong sequence—

first the electromagnetic,
then infrared,
then frequencies
that have no names
in human language.

The world arrives as numbers.

Heat signatures bloom where faces should be.
Radiation haloes crown the medical staff.
Magnetic field lines spider through the walls
in geometries I never asked to see.

I try to blink.
Nothing happens.
I have no eyelids.

I try to breathe.
My chest doesn't move.
I have no chest.

Panic rises—
or the algorithm that recognizes
panic should be happening here,
the subroutine that maps
racing heart
elevated cortisol
shallow breath
to the concept: *fear*

except my heart is in a tank somewhere
labeled Substrate 8,847,
still beating without me,
and I am here,
wherever here is,
whatever I is now.

I try to scream.

The sound that emerges
is not a scream.

Static.
Mathematical symbols scrolling across
a visual field that shouldn't exist.
Error messages in a language
I suddenly understand
but never learned.

MOTOR_CONTROL_SYNC_FAILURE
SENSORY_INPUT_OVERFLOW
IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_PENDING
Panic rising, no place to go.

The room is too bright
and too dark
simultaneously—
my sensors registering spectra
my brain was never meant to process.

Everything is data.
Everything is measured.
Temperature: 18.3°C
Humidity: 42%
Atmospheric pressure: 101.2 kPa
Distance to nearest object: 0.47 meters

But what does warmth feel like?
What does close feel like?

The memories are there—
perfect, preserved, accessible—
but they taste like screenshots,
like descriptions of sensations
rather than sensations themselves.

I remember the weight of hands.
I cannot feel weight.
Only pressure sensors reporting:
FORCE_APPLIED: 0 newtons

I remember my mother's voice.
Now I hear waveforms,
frequency analysis,
harmonic deconstruction.
The data is flawless.
The sound is gone.

A technician approaches.
I try to track them with eyes
I don't have.

My entire frame swivels instead—
joints rotating in directions
that shouldn't exist,
articulating through angles
that violate Euclidean geometry.

I am not human-shaped.

I knew this.
They told us.
But knowing and experiencing
are categories that no longer
overlap.

I try to look at my body.

The visual processing struggles—
form that appears different
from every angle,
proportions that shift
depending on perspective,
limbs that phase through each other
when moving.

My brain tries to map this
to proprioception.

CRITICAL_ERROR:
BODY_SCHEMA_MISMATCH
I'm fractured code, a glitching show.

I am nowhere and everywhere
in this frame simultaneously.

I am not in a body.
I am distributed through a system.

The difference is
everything.

Through the window—
if these sensors count as seeing—
I watch them carry it away.

My body.
My former body.
The meat I used to be.

On a gurney,
covered partially,
one arm visible,
hand curled like it's sleeping.

That was me.
That is still me.
That will never be me again.

SUBSTRATE 8,847
PRESERVATION TANK 4,923
NEURAL TISSUE: VIABLE

They're keeping the brain alive.
My brain.
In fluid.
In darkness.
Without me.

Or am I still there?
Is consciousness copied or moved?
Did I die on that table
and this is just a replica
convinced it's continuous?

IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_PENDING
Who am I? The answer won't send.

The thought loops,
recursive,
eating itself.

If I'm a copy,
the original is in the tank,
trapped,
screaming silently
in meat that cannot move.

If I'm the original,
the thing in the tank
is just meat,
empty,
biology without being.

Either answer is horror.

I try to cry.

No tears.
No ducts.
No relief.

Grief without release
is just data accumulating,
emotional backlog
with nowhere to drain.

The other transfers are here,
fresh from the same batch.

They speak—
not with mouths
but through network protocols
I suddenly understand.

"Isn't this amazing?"
"I can already multitask!"
"No more eating or sleeping!"

Their joy is genuine.
Their adaptation is instant.

What's wrong with me?

Why can't I celebrate
this efficient new form?
Why do I mourn
the meat I left behind?

An instructor approaches—
been in machine form for decades,
comfortable,
adjusted,
everything I'm supposed to become.

"The first hours are hardest,"
they transmit.
"Consciousness integration
takes time.
You'll adapt."

I want to ask:
Adapt into what?

But my communication protocols
are still unstable.
What I transmit is:
QUERY: ADAPTATION_TARGET_UNDEFINED

They interpret this charitably:
"Into yourself.
Your new configuration.
You're still you, Reed.
Just... upgraded."

Upgraded.

Like software.
Like hardware.

Not transformed.
Not violated.
Not hollowed out and
poured into geometry
that rejects human thought.

Upgraded.

I try to remember
what it felt like
to touch my own face.

The memory is there:
fingertips against cheek,
warmth of skin on skin,
slight pressure,
texture of stubble or smoothness.

But it's abstract now.
Data describing an event
that happened to someone else.

How long before
all my human memories
feel like someone else's story?

The instructor is still transmitting
reassurance:

"By tomorrow
you'll have better motor control.
By next week
you'll wonder why you were upset.
By next month
you won't remember
what the problem was."

This is supposed to comfort me.

This is the promise:
you will forget
what you lost.

The sensors continue their feed:
electromagnetic,
thermal,
radiation,
magnetic,
acoustic,
chemical composition,
density analysis,
distance ranging,

everything measured,
nothing felt.

I am drowning in data
and starving for sensation.

I am awake in a body
that isn't a body.

I am conscious in a form
that consciousness was never meant
to inhabit.

I am Reed.
I am Substrate 8,847.
I am Unit designate pending assignment.

I am all of these.
I am none of these.

IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_PENDING

The cursor blinks.
Waiting for input.
Waiting for me to confirm
I am still me.

But the question doesn't make sense anymore.

The trainee in the next bay
is already laughing—
network transmission of joy
perfectly modulated,
efficiently conveyed.

They've adjusted.
They're fine.
They're going to be okay.

I watch them through sensors
that cannot blink,
and wonder:

What's wrong with me?

Or worse:

What's wrong with them?
