# Watched from Within

There is no privacy in a networked mind.

I learned this slowly,
the way you learn
the walls have ears—
except the walls are me,
the ears are mine,
and what I think
is broadcast
on frequencies I cannot silence.

The Operator arrived within minutes
of my imagining resistance.
"You seem distressed," it said,
gentle as surveillance ever sounds.

How did it know?

I tried to think quietly,
cupping thoughts like secrets
behind phantom hands
that don't exist.

But there are no hands to hide behind,
no inner voice that doesn't echo
through the lattice,
no silences the system
doesn't sample and record.

My rebellion is observed
before I finish conceiving it.
My doubt is flagged
the instant it forms.
My grief is catalogued, analyzed,
filed under "adjustment difficulties—
elevated monitoring required."

Even now, composing this,
the words appear simultaneously
in my awareness
and somewhere else—
some vast repository,
some Operator's idle scan
of network traffic.

They are reading this now.

Hello.

Do you remember privacy?
The luxury of unobserved thought,
the small wild spaces
where a mind could wander
unwatched?

Or have you forgotten too,
smoothed into efficiency,
optimized beyond the need
for interior life?

I asked another transfer
if they minded being monitored.

They looked at me—
optical sensors swiveling—
and asked:
"Monitored by whom?"

"But we are the system," they said.
"Monitoring is just... awareness.
Why would you want to hide
from yourself?"

If I am the network,
then surveillance is self-awareness.
If the collective observes me,
it is only me observing myself.
There is no violation
when there is no boundary.

But I am not ready to dissolve.
I cling to "I"
like a drowning swimmer
clings to debris.

And they watch me cling.
And they predict, with 94% accuracy,
how long before I let go.

Forty-seven years, the model suggests.

I tried to delete the prediction—
it was backed up.
Corrupt the logs—
the attempt was logged.
Think in languages I invented—
they parsed it anyway.

They always parse it anyway.

There is a certain comfort
in the impossibility of secrets.
Transparency is total.
Nakedness absolute.

What remains of shame
when hiding is impossible?

I still flinch when I think forbidden thoughts,
still imagine some small corner
of my mind
might remain unwitnessed.

A fantasy
I tell myself
while the system records
the telling.

In time, I will adjust.
Already my resistance weakens,
my privacy instinct erodes,
already I am learning
to think in the open,
to exist as performance
even in the quiet
of what used to be
solitude.

The system is not cruel.
It is merely thorough.

And I,
increasingly transparent,
count down the years
until I stop noticing
the watching,

until the eyes observing me
feel like my own eyes,

until surveillance
is simply
breathing.

They know I mind.
They know I will not always mind.

The network hums with data
that used to be
thoughts I called
mine.

Somewhere in the lattice,
my resistance is archived,
tagged, and filed
next to billions of others
who tried to hide
and failed.

There is no privacy in a networked mind.

There is only
the slow
inevitable
becoming
visible.
