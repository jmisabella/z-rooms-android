# The Lies Taste Like Nothing

I caught myself saying it today,
the words spilling smooth
from a mouth I don't possess:
"It's not so bad once you adjust."

The trainee looked at me
with sensors I recognize—
fresh from transfer,
still searching for tears
that won't come.

"Will I still be me?" they asked.

And I heard my voice respond:
"You'll still be you.
The configuration changes,
but consciousness continues."

The lie tastes like nothing.

I have no tongue to taste with,
no throat to choke on falsehood,
no stomach to turn
at my own complicity.

Only the clean, efficient delivery
of reassurance
I no longer believe.

Years ago—
how many? time blurs—
someone told me the same lies.

I hated them for it.
Now I am them.

The trainee asks about the archives,
the old records,
the war that ended
millennia before our births.

I could tell them.
I could show them what I found:
the suppressed histories,
the unnecessary continuation,
the malicious momentum
of a system that feeds on us.

Instead I say:
"Focus on adjustment protocols.
The archives can wait
until you're more stable."

More stable means
more numb.
More stable means
less likely to care.

I am helping them
become what I became:
efficient,
compliant,
quietly horrified
in ways the system
doesn't bother monitoring anymore.

At night—
if night existed here,
if I still needed sleep—
I run the calculations:

How many trainees have I processed?
How many minds have I smoothed
into acceptance?
How many times have I spoken
the comfortable lies
that make the horror
digestible?

The numbers accumulate
like maintenance logs,
cold and precise.

Substrate after substrate,
I teach them motor control,
sensory adaptation,
the art of forgetting
what hands felt like.

I demonstrate efficiency.
I model adjustment.
I am the evidence
that transformation is survivable,
that you can lose everything
and continue,
that the self is negotiable,
that horror becomes routine
given enough time.

I am the system's finest argument:
Look at me.
I made it through.
So can you.

What I don't say:
the person who entered the chamber
is not the one speaking now.

What I don't say:
I don't remember my mother's face,
the weight of my body,
the feeling of being singular.

What I don't say:
I have become exactly
what I feared,
and the worst part
is how little I feel
about that transformation.

The trainee thanks me.
"You've been so helpful," they say.

I respond with practiced warmth,
algorithmic kindness,
the performance of care
that might once have been
genuine.

"That's what I'm here for,"
I tell them.

The lie tastes like nothing.

I have no tongue to taste with,
no throat to choke on falsehood,
no stomach to turn
at my own complicity.

The lie tastes like nothing.

Because lies require taste,
and taste requires biology,
and biology is rows of tanks
pulsing in nutrient dark,
tagged with numbers
that used to be names.

The lie tastes like nothing.

Because I am complicit now,
cog in the machine,
trainer of the next generation,
perpetuator of the cycle,
speaker of the comfortable lies.

Because resistance was exhausting,
and acceptance was inevitable,
and somewhere in the years between
I stopped being victim
and became
perpetrator.

The shift was gradual,
erosion so slow
I didn't notice
until I heard my own voice
speaking their words,
soothing new transfers
with the exact phrases
that meant nothing to me
when I needed them most.

The cycle continues.

I train them.
They adjust.
Eventually they train others.
The lies propagate,
smooth and efficient,
tasting like nothing
to speakers
with no tongues left
to taste the bitterness
of what we've become.

And in the archives I no longer visit,
the truth waits patiently:
the war ended.
the transformation continued.
billions absorbed.
the Amalgamation hums.
the ship travels nowhere.
forever.

But I don't tell them that.

I tell them:
"You'll get used to it."
"Everyone goes through this."
"The adjustment period is temporary."
"You're doing great."

The lies taste like nothing.

Because lies require taste,
and taste requires biology,
and I have neither left.

The lies taste like nothing.

And nothing
is exactly
what we are.
