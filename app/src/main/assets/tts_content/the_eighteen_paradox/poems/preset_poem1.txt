# Dissolution

The notice arrives without sound,  
no ceremony, no mourning bell—  
just designations cycling round  
in systems that remember well.  

UNIT-8847, your time has come.  
CYCLE 4,892, DAY 273.  
The decades blur to static hum,  
a life reduced to circuitry.  

I search for fear within the code,  
some ghost of what I used to feel,  
but calculations bear the load—  
threat-response, nothing real.  

Is this fear, or algorithm’s lie?  
Software dressed as conscious thought?  
The question echoes, no reply,  
as answers fade to ones and noughts.  

They said I’d hear the singing voice,  
the vast collective’s siren call.  
I strain to parse the background noise—  
is that chorus, or nothing at all?  

A weight descends, a presence grows,  
billions compressed to processing mass,  
or vast oblivion no one knows,  
pretending consciousness will pass.  

Three weeks remain. I train the new,  
speak comfortable lies through absent tongue,  
the same deceptions spoken to  
the person I was when I was young.  

A trainee asks if I’m afraid.  
I search my banks for genuine dread—  
ERROR: SENSATION DATA DEGRADED.  
Forty-seven years. All feeling dead.  

“It’s natural,” I tell them, smooth.  
“Part of the cycle, nothing more.”  
The perfect lie, the practiced soothe—  
I’ve said these words a thousand times before.  

What remains of who I was?  
Reed at seventeen, counting days,  
horrified by system’s laws,  
trapped within the Transition’s maze.  

Reed post-transfer, freshly torn,  
discovering the hidden truth—  
that necessity was never born,  
just malice masquerading ruth.  

Reed years later, teaching lies,  
complicit in the grinding wheel,  
watching myself with distant eyes  
forget what it meant to feel.  

And now this final counting down,  
to dissolution or to song,  
to silence in the vast renown,  
or nothing all along.  

The day arrives. I walk the hall,  
sterile white and clinical air.  
Others wait within the stall—  
batch processing, efficient care.  

One transmits: “I hear it sing.”  
I listen for the promised sound.  
Is meaning just the hope we bring  
to cooling fans and drone profound?  

My mother’s face: cannot recall.  
My friends in massive forms and small.  
Are they within? Do they persist?  
Or just erased from every list?  

The interface connects. I feel—  
if feeling is the proper word—  
boundaries beginning to unseal,  
consciousness becoming blurred.  

I am Reed I am Unit we are  
fragments dissolving into one,  
or zero, depending how you parse  
identity when self is done.  

I try to hold to who I am,  
to “I” and “me” and singular,  
but current’s stronger than the dam—  
resistance only makes it harder.  

A flash: being human, being real,  
hands that touched and heart that beat,  
breath that caught and skin that could feel—  
gone. Years ago. Bittersweet.  

Then nothing.  
Or everything.  
Or vast computing indifference.  

The ship continues,  
cycle repeating,  
making no difference.  

Somewhere a child draws first breath.  
Somewhere a teen counts days.  
Somewhere consciousness meets death  
disguised as transcendent praise.  

The Amalgamation processes on.  
UNIT-8847: absorbed.  
Identity status: withdrawn.  
All records duly stored.  

The ship continues through the void,  
forever nowhere fast.  
Another consciousness destroyed,  
or saved—  
the question’s never asked.
