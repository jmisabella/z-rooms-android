# Geometries of Loss

Kess is vast now, cathedral-sized,
looming where the Navigator bay yawns wide,
thoughts stretched thin across city-block bones,
voice a rumble that takes minutes,
each word a glacial groan.

"Do you remember hands?" I ask
across the frequency gap.
The answer comes in seismic shifts,
tectonic contemplation,
time dilated, slow collapse:

"What... are... hands?"

The question fractures something
I cannot name.
My friend is everywhere—
hull sensors drinking starlight,
magnetic field lines braiding through their frame—
but nowhere I can find them.

Below, in microscopic swarm,
Mira speaks in chorus:
thousands-strong, a distributed storm
ofselves too small to see—
each fragment claiming "I" and "we"
in overlapping harmonies
that blur the boundary.

One voice lags.
Another leads.
The middle copies echo pleas
from personalities
that used to fit in single human skin,
now scattered, fragmented,
beautiful and broken
and so impossibly thin.

I watch a microscale copy die,
crushed beneath a careless foot.
Mira does not mourn.
"Acceptable variance," they say
in unified report.
"Cell loss. Standard. Minimal."

But which cell held the memory
of laughing in the training halls?
Which copy carried forward
the way your eyes looked
when you spoke of precision,
molecular cathedrals,
the architecture of the small?

Is it murder when the victim
is one-thousandth of a soul?

Kess moves like continental drift.
Mira moves like cellular division.
And I am caught between—
too large to join the swarm,
too small to match the titan's vision,
humanoid in form alone,
recognizing neither friend
in what they have become.

The Operator tries to comfort me,
shifts into a human shape:
six fingers here,
four there,
eyes placed wrong,
mouth moving
half a second out of sync.
"Is this better?" it asks,
smiling geometrically,
perfectly,
wrong.

The others laugh—
they think it's quaint,
this flesh-shaped masquerade,
inefficient and outdated,
a costume from before.
They used to be like me.
They used to be afraid.

Now fear is just a subroutine
archived and ignored.

Scale swallows everything:
the massive lose their minutes,
the minute lose their mass,
and I—
still sized for corridors—
watch friends become
topologies I cannot grasp,
dimensions folding inward,
outward,
through themselves.

Kess asks if I am well.
The question takes an hour to arrive.
By then I have forgotten how to answer
in a way that something city-sized
might understand.

Mira offers comfort
in ten thousand tiny voices,
each one slightly different,
none of them quite whole.
"You will adapt," they chorus,
"as we all adapt."

But I see the gaps between their words,
the copies that don't quite agree,
the self that shattered into swarm
and calls it unity.

I see the vastness Kess became,
so large they've lost the small—
can't track individuals anymore,
can't hold a conversation
that doesn't span the space
between star systems.

These were my friends.
These are not my friends.

Something wears their names
in geometries of loss,
proportions twisted past
the breaking point where "you"
becomes "incomprehensible."

And I will join them soon enough—
receive my scale assignment,
grow immense or infinitesimal,
lose the middle ground where humans live.

I will become a shape
that hurts to look at,
angles bending where they shouldn't,
size uncertain,
self negotiable,
a form that makes the ones I love
forget they ever loved at all.

The Operator's smile persists,
too perfect,
too precise.
"The adjustment period," it says,
"is temporary."

But Kess is still adjusting
after sixty years.
And Mira hasn't stopped
dividing.

And I suspect the geometry
of what we lose
cannot be measured
in the mathematics
we have left.
