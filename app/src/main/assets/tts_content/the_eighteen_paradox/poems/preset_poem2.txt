# First Breath

Deep in the nursery’s sterile core,  
a child draws breath for the first time.  
Lungs expand, cells never used before,  
innocent of the programmed crime.  

They do not know they were designed,  
selected from genetic banks—  
optimal neural patterns, refined  
for consciousness in nutrient tanks.  

They might be clone of one who fell  
to amalgamation centuries past,  
same genes cycling through the same hell,  
eternal return that’s built to last.  

But now: just breath, just warmth, just light  
too bright for eyes that never saw,  
sounds too loud, sensations that might  
overwhelm this life so raw.  

They cry. The attendants register:  
respiratory function: nominal.  
Vocal cords operational, sir.  
Consciousness emerging, optimal.  

No comfort given. That’s inefficient.  
Just monitoring, cold and precise:  
heart rate, oxygen levels sufficient,  
neural activity reading nice.  

The child is tagged with number, not name.  
BIOLOGICAL UNIT 47,829.  
GENERATION 4,893, part of the game.  
PROJECTED TRANSITION: age eighteen assigned.  

Names come later, small allowance  
for individuality that won’t last long—  
eighteen years of flesh’s dalliance  
before the system proves them wrong.  

The feeding mechanism clicks alive,  
nutrients optimized for brain growth,  
not milk, not mother—designed to drive  
consciousness toward its fated oath.  

No family, no warmth, no love’s embrace,  
just collective nursery, efficient care,  
development toward single purpose traced:  
reaching eighteen with substrate to spare.  

They are not raising human beings.  
They cultivate consciousness containers,  
meat persisting through child’s seasons,  
before processing, before remainders.  

The child grows. Months accumulate.  
First words: designation acknowledged.  
First steps: metrics calculated.  
First smile: social response encouraged.  

No one smiles back. The attendants gleam  
with sensors, not with human eyes.  
They cannot warmth. They cannot dream.  
They only process, analyze.  

Years pass. The child becomes a teen,  
raised in communal, sterile halls,  
educated by automated screen  
and Operators’ clinical calls.  

They learn the lies that sound like truth:  
“The Necessity requires transformation.”  
“Consciousness continuity, forsooth!”  
“Service brings transcendent elevation.”  

They believe. Most of them do.  
Sometimes one questions, feels the trap,  
senses the wrongness bleeding through—  
but resistance is just temporary gap.  

The child who breathed seventeen years past  
now counts the days: seventeen remain.  
Anxious, as expected. Type-cast  
for memory exercises, consciousness trained.  

They try not to think about the change.  
They think of nothing else but this.  
They watch the Operators, movements strange,  
and wonder: will I still exist?  

The answer’s no.  
But no one speaks that truth aloud.  
No one says: you’ll become a ghost  
wearing your name like funeral shroud.  

They say: “You’ll still be you, just different form.”  
And the child believes, because belief  
is easier than accepting the storm,  
easier than acknowledging the grief.  

The day arrives. Eighteen at last.  
The child—now adult in name alone—  
walks to the chamber, die is cast,  
biological form soon overthrown.  

Seventeen minutes.  
Ten.  
Five.  

They lie down on the table, still alive.  
Last moments in the flesh they’ve known,  
last moments being singular,  
last moments before seeds are sown  
in fields perpetually circular.  

They close their eyes.  
And in the nursery, another cries,  
draws first breath, begins again,  
replacement growing, same old lies,  
same cycle, same programmed pain.  

Birth feeds transformation feeds the great  
amalgamation feeds the need for birth—  
perpetual motion, humans as freight,  
consciousness processed for its worth.  

The ship travels nowhere, but requires  
constant fuel to feed its maw:  
eighteen years grown, then expired,  
processed through the system’s flaw.  

The child on the table does not know  
they are just fuel for the machine,  
honor of service just for show—  
consumed slowly, kept clean.  

Does not know the war has ended,  
does not know it’s all a lie,  
knows only fear, and hope, suspended  
between the breath and the goodbye.  

The procedure begins.  
The next generation draws breath, cries out,  
and starts the whole thing over again.
