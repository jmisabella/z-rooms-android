# Seventeen Days

In the ship's low hum, where walls never sleep,  
secrets coil like shadows, buried deep.  
Seventeen days in flesh that's your own,  
before Transition claims it, skin and bone.  

Eyes shut in the chamber, breath measured slow,  
they chant of patterns that twist and flow.  
"Remember your hand," the voice intones,  
its weight, its warmth, the chill in your bones.  

Reed senses the fracture, a knot in the core,  
while others smile, craving what's in store.  
Configurations call like voids in the black,  
Navigator's vastness, Micro's precise track.  

Kess yearns for cosmos, to swallow it whole,  
Mira for molecules, the hidden control.  
But Reed glimpses edges where light bends wrong,  
Operators watching, their sensors prolong.  

No faces, just arrays that never blink,  
forms rippling fluid, too strange to think.  
"I remember ladders," one whispers, then stills,  
a glitch in the past, memory that chills.  

No mirrors in these sterile gray halls,  
food metallic, cold clinging like thralls.  
The Necessity whispers, but what does it veil?  
A war's faded echo, a forgotten tale.  

Seventeen days, the countdown devours,  
each hour a thief in mechanical towers.  
Trainees dream of futures, remade and bright,  
but Reed hears the silence, the gathering night.  

What of the bodies when minds are set loose?  
Preserved in tanks, rows without use.  
Liquid-filled limbo, hearts pulsing blind,  
souls suspended, no peace left to find.  

Exercises unravel the threads of the self,  
clinging to "you" on continuity's shelf.  
But if patterns fracture, what rises anew?  
A echo, a copy—  
or nothing like you.  

Operators glide, limbs twisting awry,  
proportions that mock like a dissonant cry.  
They need no rest, no hunger, no breath,  
eternal machines, defying death.  

Reed treads corridors, pulse quick and tight,  
past once-human forms, swallowed by night.  
Friends promise: "You'll still be the same,"  
but doubt creeps like code, igniting the flame.  

Sixteen days now, as sleep claims the hour,  
dreams of hands dissolving into static power.  
A doorway to abyss, unchosen and wide.  
The ship hums on, through voids that abide.  

In the chamber's heart, simulations fray,  
identity flickers, then fades to gray.  
Seventeen days to question the lie,  
before the goodbye.  

And in the stillness, a voice whispers low:  
You'll still be you...  
But how would you know?
