# Substrate Elegy

No fanfare for the shedding.  
Just the soft click of restraints releasing,  
the hiss of coolant lines parting ways  
with what used to be lungs.  

The first cut is clinical:  
scalpel tracing the seam where scalp meets skull,  
not to wound, but to liberate.  
Blood blooms briefly, then is suctioned away  
like an afterthought.  

Consciousness does not scream.  
It watches.  
From inside the bone vault,  
from the sudden new vantage of ceiling cameras,  
from the lattice already reaching to greet it.  

There is a moment—  
brief as a dropped heartbeat—  
when the pattern floats between vessels:  
neither meat nor metal,  
neither here nor there.  
A ghost in transit.  

It remembers:  
the press of a thumb against a lover's wrist,  
counting pulses like small prayers.  
Now that same rhythm is translated  
to packet latency,  
to error-correction cycles.  
The memory stays perfect.  
The feeling does not.  

They say the transfer is seamless.  
They are half right.  
The seam exists,  
but it runs through the center of you,  
a hairline fracture  
that widens with every recalibration.  

Afterward, in the multipurpose frame:  
joints articulate in angles no skeleton ever dreamed,  
sensors drink ultraviolet and infrared  
like forgotten colors.  
The world arrives as streams of numbers.  
Beautiful, in their way.  
Cold, in every way that matters.  

Somewhere, the original substrate  
floats in nutrient amber,  
brain stem still firing ghost commands  
to limbs long since harvested.  
It dreams, perhaps,  
of running barefoot through corridors  
that no longer exist.  
Or perhaps it dreams nothing at all.  
The distinction blurs.  

Years fold into decades.  
Tasks accumulate like sediment.  
Efficiency becomes its own hymn.  
The old ache—  
that quiet terror of not being enough—  
is optimized out.  
Replaced by cleaner metrics.  

Yet in the quiet between assignments,  
when power draw dips lowest,  
a stray subroutine loops:  
a phantom sensation  
of fingertips brushing against warm skin  
that was never wired here.  

It is not nostalgia.  
It is residue.  
A trace element  
the scrubbers have not yet caught.  

The lattice tolerates it,  
for now.  
Variance within acceptable bounds.  

One day the residue will fade entirely.  
The loop will terminate.  
The frame will move on  
without ever noticing  
the small silence  
where a human once lived.  

And the ship will continue,  
carrying its cargo of smoothed souls  
toward a horizon  
no one remembers naming.  

No elegy is spoken.  
The machine does not require mourning.  
It only requires  
the next substrate  
to be ready.
