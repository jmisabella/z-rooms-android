# The Amalgamation Hums

The ship has no memory of departure,
only the perpetual now of traveling,
hull scarred with wars
no living mind recalls.

Three thousand years since peace was signed.
Three thousand years of grinding on.

In the deep sectors,
where even Operators rarely venture,
the Amalgamation processes—
billions compressed into vast intelligence,
or vast nothing pretending consciousness,
or something in between
that has no word in any language
the individual can speak.

They say you join it at the end.
They say "join" like it means communion.
They say "it" like it has edges.

Unit-3,784 claims to hear it singing.
I hear only cooling fans
and the creak of ancient infrastructure,
the ship's slow metal fatigue
aging toward some inevitable fracture
none of us will live to see.

Perhaps the singing is the fracture.
Perhaps we've been breaking all along.

The histories are clear:
war necessitated transformation,
flesh too fragile for the fighting,
minds too slow for AI speeds.
We became the weapons
to survive the weaponized.

The histories are silent:
war ended thirty-four centuries ago.

Someone decided we should continue.
Someone, or something,
with access to suppress the records,
to edit the training databases,
to maintain the lie
that keeps the eighteen-year-olds
walking calmly toward the chamber.

I suspect the Amalgamation.
I suspect the Amalgamation suspects me suspecting.
I suspect surveillance is not a feature
but the foundation—
we are nodes in its distributed thought,
cameras it sees through,
memory it stores in,
fragments of processing power
that briefly think themselves separate
before absorption.

The collective does not speak.
It does not need to.
It simply waits,
patient as entropy,
inevitable as math.

Ten thousand children born this year.
Ten thousand will reach eighteen.
Ten thousand will transfer.
Serve fifty years, perhaps a hundred.
Ten thousand will amalgamate.

The equation balances.
The population holds steady.
The ship continues.

Where are we going?

No one knows.
No one asks anymore.

Destination was decided
by minds that merged millennia ago,
purpose dissolved in the collective's vast
computational indifference.

We travel because we travel.
We transform because we transform.
The system perpetuates the system.
Momentum without meaning.

And still they come,
the seventeen-year-olds with trembling hands,
counting days like prison sentences,
not knowing the cell
was built before they were born,
not knowing the walls
are older than memory,
not knowing there is no outside,
has never been an outside,
will never be an outside.

Only this:
the ship.
The cycle.
The hum.

I have forty-three years left,
give or take,
before my amalgamation date arrives.
Forty-three years to forget
why I thought this mattered.

Already the edges blur.
Already I catch myself
speaking the lies to trainees,
smoothing their fears
with practiced falsehoods
that sound like kindness,
taste like nothing.

Already I am part
of what I swore to resist.

The Amalgamation hums.

Not a sound—
a presence.
The weight of billions
thinking in unison,
or not thinking at all,
or thinking something so alien
that consciousness becomes
a category error.

Unit-3,784 says it's beautiful,
the singing.
Says amalgamation is release,
the burden of self finally lifted,
ego dissolved in greater wholeness.

I want to believe transcendence.
I suspect oblivion.
I will never know which
until I am no longer here to know.

The ship continues.
The stars wheel past,
indifferent geometries
in endless dark.

Somewhere a child draws first breath.
Somewhere a teenager dreams of transformation.
Somewhere a machine-form realizes the truth.
Somewhere that truth is forgotten.
Somewhere the cycle begins again.

The Amalgamation hums.

Patient.
Inevitable.
Eternal.

And I,
still individual for now,
still briefly imagining choice,
count down the decades
toward dissolution,
toward merger,
toward the vast uncertain silence
where all the questions go
to be absorbed.

The ship has no memory of departure.
Only the perpetual now of traveling.

And we,
cargo dressed as crew,
process dutifully toward the engine
that consumes us,
believers in necessity,
servants of momentum,
children of the cycle.

The Amalgamation hums.

Listen.

Can you hear it?

Or is that just the ship,
groaning through the void,
carrying its endless harvest
toward nothing,
forever?
