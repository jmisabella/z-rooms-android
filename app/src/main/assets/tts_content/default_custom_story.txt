Close your eyes… (1.2s) and picture a hallway. (3s)

Not one you've been in… (0.8s) but one that feels (0.3s) almost (0.4s) familiar. (2.5s)

The walls are painted a color (0.6s) you can't quite name. (1.8s)
Something between green (0.5s) and gray. (0.8s)
Institutional. (0.6s) Cold. (2.5s)

The floor is linoleum… (1.2s) scuffed from years of footsteps. (2.8s)
There are doors on both sides… (1.5s) evenly spaced… (1.2s) all closed. (3.5s)

The fluorescent lights above you (0.8s) hum. (1.5s)
One of them flickers… (0.6s) on… (0.4s) off… (0.5s) on… (2s)
Casting shadows that shouldn't move… (1s) but do. (4s)

You're walking now. (1.8s)
Your footsteps echo… (0.8s) but there's something else. (2s)
Another set of footsteps… (1.5s) behind you… (1.2s) matching your pace exactly. (3.5s)

You stop. (2s)
They stop. (3.5s)

You turn around. (2.5s)
The hallway stretches back (0.8s) impossibly far… (1.5s) empty. (4s)

But you can feel it. (1.8s)
That presence. (1.2s)
Watching. (0.8s)
Waiting. (3s)

You continue forward. (1.5s)
The air grows colder with each step. (2.5s)
Your breath (0.6s) begins to fog. (3s)

One of the doors… (1.2s) the third one on the left… (1.5s) is slightly ajar. (3s)

You know you shouldn't look… (1.8s) but you do. (2.5s)

Inside… (1.5s) darkness. (2s)
Complete darkness. (2.5s)
Except… (1.2s) two points of light. (2s)
Reflecting. (1.5s)
Unblinking. (3.5s)

The door creaks wider. (2s)
You didn't touch it. (3s)

From inside the room… (1.5s) a whisper. (2s)
Not words exactly… (1.2s) more like the shape of words. (2.5s)
The memory of language. (3.5s)

It knows your name. (4s)

You step back… (1.2s) but the hallway (0.8s) has changed. (2.5s)
The doors are closer together now. (2s)
The ceiling lower. (1.8s)
The walls… (0.8s) breathing. (3.5s)

That smell. (1.5s)
Copper. (1s)
Old flowers. (1.2s)
Something rotting beneath floorboards. (3.5s)

The footsteps behind you (1.2s) begin again. (2s)
Closer this time. (2.5s)
And there's breathing… (1.5s) wet… (0.8s) labored… (1.2s) almost at your neck. (4s)

You want to run… (1.5s) but your legs (0.8s) won't move. (2.5s)
They're so heavy. (1.8s)
Like you're underwater. (0.8s)
Or dreaming. (3s)

Maybe (0.8s) you are dreaming. (3.5s)

But then… (1.2s) you feel it. (2s)
A hand. (1.5s)
Cold fingers (0.8s) wrapping around your shoulder. (3s)

Slowly… (1.5s) so slowly… (1.2s) you turn your head. (4s)

And there… (2s) right beside you… (2.5s) close enough to touch… (3.5s)

Is something (1.2s) that was once (0.8s) like you. (4s)

It smiles. (3s)
Its teeth (1s) too many (0.8s) and wrong. (3.5s)

And it whispers… (2s)
"I've been waiting (1.2s) such a long time (1.5s) for you to come back." (5s)

The lights go out. (4s)

All of them. (3s)

At once. (4s)

And in that perfect darkness… (2s) you hear it. (2.5s)

The sound of all those doors… (2s) opening. (5s)

One. (2s)
By. (2s)
One. (5s)

And from each doorway… (2s) something steps out. (3s)

They've been waiting too. (4s)

All of them. (3s)

For you. (5s)

The darkness (1.2s) is complete now. (2.5s)
You can't see (0.8s) but you can feel them. (2s)

Surrounding you. (2.5s)
Pressing in. (2s)
Their breath on your skin. (3s)

And you realize… (2s) with perfect clarity… (2.5s)
that you've been here before. (4s)

Many times. (3s)

You just don't remember. (4s)

But they do. (5s)

They always remember. (6s)

And now… (2s) you're home. (8s)
