The Pull

The light pools where it has no source —
along the seam, a sourceless glow
with no lamp to account for it, settled there
so long it seems to know

the corridor the way you know it.
You have walked this hall for years.
Memorized each lamp, each angle.
This light simply appears

from nowhere you have learned.
It simply is.

The sound is not a sound.
It lives below reception —
a frequency the body reads before the mind
arrives to form a question.

You feel it in the chest. The hands.
A hum that does not stop
at the edge of what can be named,
that lifts you like a prop

beneath the feet. A current.
Not voice. Not silence. Something heard
below the ordinary, working in you
before you've formed a word

about it.

The shadow moves ahead of you.
A beat. A half-step's lead.
Your shape already rounding the next corner.
You follow, freed

from the decision — following
your own dark into the hall you hadn't meant to take.
Your feet find the junction
before your waking has a chance to wake.

You find yourself already there.
Hand against the wall.
Not the stillness of a place that waited —
the stillness of a place that knew your call.

The pull is not your longing.
The pull is not your grief or want or need —
it is a direction with coordinates,
a signal your body was designed to read.

You can feel the precision now.
This junction. This correction
in the body's sense of forward.
This wall. This seam. This connection

between your blood and the frequency
it chose. Something measured this location.
Something chose this wall, this glow,
this low hum — with calculation.

Something placed this call before you.
Chose the junction, chose the seam —
measured the distance from your blood
to the signal, built the dream

into the architecture of the ordinary
dark you've always known.

Something has been patient in the walls,
in the bone-deep frequency,
in the light.

It knows your arrival time.
It has always known.
You have been answering this call
since before it was your own.

You are almost there.

You have been almost there since before
you learned to call the ship your home.
