By the Design

The phrase was in our mouths before our teeth.
We learned it with the morning, with the light,
with everything the world provided freely—
before we thought to ask who gave that right.

By the design. We said it before eating.
We said it in the doorways, before thought—
the daily small inheritance of language,
passed down through all the lives the years had brought

back to the ones who first composed the phrase,
who pressed the meaning in with cold intention,
who knew exactly what they were constructing:
a truth that did not need to draw attention

to itself. That needed only use.
It needed only morning after morning,
the phrase before the meal, the young receiving
it as breath, as world—a gift requiring no warning,

no examination. We said the name for home.
We said it to the meal, the light, the dead.
We gave it to our children with the day,
and did not look inside the word we said.

The word meant farthest distance. Meant the cold
extreme, the absolute remove, the turn
from which the ones who named it had intended
to come back. We said it past concern,

past questioning, into the groove of reflex.
The name was for their return, not ours.
The word for home described the point of leaving—
their leaving. We had lived inside the hours

as though the word were simply what it sounded.
By the design. As though design were given
the way the light was given, and the air,
the way a truth becomes so long-lived

it stops requiring recognition. We said:
the Arrival. Said it like a grace—
a certainty held gently past the needing
to articulate, past asking whose the face

would be, whose hands were at the end prepared
to close around the thing they'd always claimed.
The question had no purchase in the language.
The language had been shaped by those who named

the world before we lived inside the naming.
Not locked—no door was shut, no question barred.
The shape of what could be asked had been made small
across the generations, slow, unmarred

by any single act of suppression.
We spoke inside the small and did not feel
the edge of it, the limit of the given.
We said the ordinary words. The meal.

The morning phrase. The corridor. The doorway.
The word for home. We said it without strain—
we said it with the faith of the inherited,
and did not hear what speaking it explained.

Truth does not need concealment. It needs only
the cover of the commonplace, the veil
of repetition thick enough to muffle
the meaning into something worn and pale

and daily. Shapeless with the years of saying.
It waits inside the word you say like breath,
before you are awake enough to hear it—
below the morning, patient underneath.

It was already in your mouth this morning.
It has been there for years.
