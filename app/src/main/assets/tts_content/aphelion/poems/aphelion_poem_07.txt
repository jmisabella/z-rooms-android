Already Walking

They wake and they have walked.
The corridor. The junction. The seam.
The hands already flat against the panel —
the far end of a dream

they cannot trace back to its beginning.
Not lost. Arrived.
The body made the calculation
while the mind was deprived

of the choosing.
They do the small accounting:
restless sleep, they say.
I've always been this way. The counting

is how they leave it — tidy,
private, unremarkable —
and return to their quarters.
They do not speak the syllable

that would make it a pattern.
Each returns alone.
Each finds the junction privately
and walks home

without naming what they found there.
The seam is warm sometimes —
as if another hand was just here —
they let that detail climb

no further than the ordinary.
The pull prepared for this:
the privacy of each return,
the near-miss

between the body's certainty
and the mind's accounting.
Something needed them uncompared —
each return uncounted

by the others, each arrival
filed as singular, as theirs.
It chose the silence the way it chose the seam —
with the same cold care

it laid the signal into the blood
before the blood was here.
Patient in the structure,
waiting in the bone —

precise about this junction,
this wall, this tone
in the frequency, this particular hour,
this threshold of the half-asleep

where the signal has its power.

They wake and they have walked.
They file it. They move on.
The explanation — restless sleep — is gone

before they reach the doorway.
The signal proceeds.
Every hand against this wall,
every night the body feeds

the record without knowing —
the field fills, the count is kept.
The gathered. The arrived. The turned.

They are not wandering.
They are not lost.
The call was placed before them.
They are the ones it crossed

the generations to collect.
