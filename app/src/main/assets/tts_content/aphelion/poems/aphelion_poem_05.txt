They were here before the first generation drew breath inside these walls.
That is the oldest fact about this place:
the making preceded the made,
and what came after
was built to fit the shape of what had come before.

The corridors were walked before there were feet.
The phrases were composed before there were mouths to carry them —
built into the morning, the doorway, the meal,
into the slot in the day where meaning settles
before it can be examined.
Three syllables made ordinary
in the time it takes a generation to forget
that ordinary is not the same as natural.

They measured the light — what kind, how much, to what effect —
because they needed to understand what sustained exposure does to a population
across a generation, and the generation beyond that, and the one beyond that.
They had the patience of the long calculation.
They knew the useful result would take more than a lifetime to arrive
and did not require them to be present for it.

They wrote the myth of themselves before the myth was old enough to be believed.
They wrote: wise. They wrote: far-seeing. They wrote: the ones who provided.
And the myth was not wrong. They were precise. They were careful.
They saw the long way and prepared for it.
The stories said so. The stories were accurate.
The stories were the first thing built.

They embedded themselves in the structure of belief
before there was anyone inside the structure to believe —
the frame of the room was designed before the room was entered,
and you cannot dismantle the frame of a room from inside the room.
This was understood before the first generation arrived.
It was not an oversight. It was the design.

When they built the last mechanism —
the one designed to move like weather at the predetermined point,
the one encoded patient in the walls before any wall was called home —
they built it with the same precision:
knowing the release, knowing the pull, knowing the junction and the seam
and the frequency that would carry the population to the place prepared.
This was not separate from the experiment.
This was the final observation.

They did not hate the ones they placed inside the vessel.
Hatred requires a subject. They had subjects.
Specimens are different from the hated.

There is no one at the end of a signal path waiting to receive anger.
They built the distance between themselves and the reaching —
the distance holds.

Inside the phrase before every meal.
Inside the name they gave the ship —
chosen with precision, then worn smooth by years into ordinary.
Inside the biology moving through the blood of the turned.
Inside the silence of the ones who manage what may be known.

The design persists.
It measures everything that can be measured.
It has a field in the data for everything that matters.

The calculation continues, exactly as it was always going to continue.
The vessel carries its cargo through the prescribed dark.
The design holds everything it was designed to hold.

This, precisely, is what they encoded as home.
