The Unaccounted

The pull has her. This is known
before sitting down beside her —
the signal in the blood, the draw
toward the particular

junction she returns to, waking
already at the seam, hand
against the wall, the call
placed in her before she began.

There is no argument that reaches
what is reaching her. No way
to intercept the thing already running.

What can be done is: stay.

Sit beside her. Hold her hand.
Not rescue. Not a cure.
Just presence — the body that remains
when remaining is the only door

still open. She does not speak.
There is nothing to say to where she is.
She does not try to turn the signal —
she stays. Just this:

the room, the hand, the breathing,
the familiar face inside the dark
of somewhere she cannot follow.
This is the whole of the work.


The experiment was designed
to measure everything it could.
It built its fields with patience —
the weight of isolation, what the good

intentions of a closed world
do to the enclosed over years,
how a people lose their horizon,
how a generation disappears

into the shape of what's available
when what's available has been designed.
It tracked degradation. Calculated
the behavior of a mind

under pressure, at the void,
at the long exhaustion of a purpose
no one remembers.
It had fields for how a people surface

into ending. How a system
yields when the yielding has been planned.
It had fields failure.

It had no field for the hand.

For the hand that does not release
the hand beside it. For the grip
used as an anchor in the dark.
For the leaving that doesn't happen — the slip

that remains a choice not made.
For the body that stays past use,
past plan, past the last point
where staying has something to lose.

For presence with no outcome.
For the only act remaining
chosen because it is the only thing.
Not rescue. Not reclaiming

what is gone. Just this:
the room, the hand, the breathing.
One person beside one person in the dark.
The one thing the data has no field for.


The darkness holds.
The data runs.
The system does exactly what it was built to do.

And inside it: this.
Two people. One hand.

Not recorded.
Not designed for.

The experiment was built
to study how we end.

It did not end here.
