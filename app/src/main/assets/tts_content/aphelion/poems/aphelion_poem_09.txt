The Name

They needed it as notation —
a word for where the ship would be
at the moment they intended to retrieve it:
the farthest point, the cold degree

of maximum remove from any star.
The outer arc. The end of the going-out.
They found the word already in the science,
pressed it to the record, had no doubt

about what they were naming. It described
a position. Not a people. Not
the smell of morning, not the corridor's
particular light — they named a spot

in the long calculation of return.
They gave it notation, not a face.
They marked it in the manifest and moved on.
They meant it for a marker, not a place

someone would call home.


And yet — it came to us the way all words come:
in the mouths of those who went before,
worn smooth with saying, all history scraped away —
the word for world, the word for door,

the word for home, for morning, for the dead,
for the child before the child has words,
the name you press into a life at its beginning
along with all the other wordless cords

of meaning. We received it as the air —
as given, as the shape of what exists,
the only country we were born to know.
We did not look for what persists

beneath the ordinary. We did not think
the name of home could carry two things at once —
the warmth we'd filled it with across the generations,
the cold thing at its center, never once

moved by our saying.

Two lives in the same sound.
Two meanings in the single shape.
Their notation. Our word for ground.


We said the name for home.
They wrote the name for what they'd sent.
The word held both without confusion —
our warmth meant nothing to the cold intent

that sat inside it, patient, from the first.
We filled the word with love. It did not shift.
A coordinate does not become a country
simply because the people living in it

name it with their dead, and say it daily,
and press it into children as a gift.

The word described us perfectly to them.
It did not describe us to ourselves.
We spoke it every morning — spoke it over everything —
and never heard what it was saying,

in the language of the ones who chose it,
about where we were,
and why.
