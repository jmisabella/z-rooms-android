At This Distance

At this distance, it is a small thing.

A manufactured object on a long course
through the void —
its velocity was set once,
and the void accepted it,
and the void has been accepting it
for longer than the people inside
have been alive.

The hull holds what is inside it
against what is outside.
There is no pressing, at this distance —
only the differential,
the managed gradient
between interior and exterior,
the systems maintaining the conditions
for the life inside to continue.

The systems run.
They have always run.
They were built to run
without interruption,
without opinion,
for longer than anyone
now breathing in the corridors
can usefully imagine.

The object moves.
The systems run.
The life inside continues.

It breathes.
It metabolizes.
It sleeps and wakes
on the schedule the designers gave it.
The air moves through the recyclers
and comes out breathable
and is breathed.

By any external measure:
cargo.

The systems do not distinguish.
The systems maintain.


At this distance, you cannot see inside.

You cannot see the corridor
where someone is awake before their shift —
not going anywhere, not needed anywhere,
walking because the corridor is known,
because the particular smell of it,
the particular resistance of the floor underfoot,
is the shape of the only world
this person has ever had.

You cannot see the hand
reach without looking
and find the wall
exactly where it has always been.

The specific knowledge of a body
that has lived long enough
in one place
to know where things are in the dark.


The object moves.
The void continues around it.
The stars it moves among
do not register its passage.

Somewhere inside the hull:
a hand.
A wall.
The ordinary knowledge of the familiar.

The systems run.
The object continues.
