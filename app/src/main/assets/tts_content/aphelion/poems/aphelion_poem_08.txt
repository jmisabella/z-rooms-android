The Carrying

They did not mean harm.
This is the thing that does not resolve it.

They knew.
They sat in rooms with the knowledge
and decided — as the generation before them decided,
and the generation before that —
that knowing is a weight
placed on a person who cannot put it down
and cannot use it.

They said: what would change.
They said: there is no recourse,
no destination they could reroute to,
no authority at all —
the ones who made this
cannot be reached, cannot be answered to,
will receive nothing you send.

So they held it.
They filed it where only they could find it
and went out to the corridors and the meals
and said: by the design,
the way everyone says it,
without flinching.

What that cost is its own subject.

The sleep of the ones who hold this.
The meals taken before the daily phrase —
whether there is a beat
in the interval between sitting and saying it
when the knowledge moves.

They do not think of themselves as guards.
They think of themselves as the ones
who absorbed the weight
so others didn't have to.

And maybe they were right.
Maybe the truth offered freely
would have done exactly what they feared —
panic, the grief of a population
with nowhere to put the grief,
no recourse at the end of it.

Maybe the mercy was real.
Maybe the theft was also real.
These are not contradictions.
They are the same act, seen from different distances.

What it costs to be protected:
you are kept whole
by someone else's carrying.
You are given the ordinary day
by someone who has not had the ordinary
for as long as they can remember.
You are allowed to say the phrase
and not know what it means,
while somewhere in the ship
someone says it knowing exactly,
and does not let the knowing show,
and has not let it show for years.

You are allowed not to carry this.
Someone decided that for you —
which is the only way
that decision can be made.

There are no villains here.

There are only people
in rooms with knowledge
making the oldest calculation:
what costs more, the telling or the not-telling —
and getting it wrong
in a way that can't be proven wrong
the other path was never walked.

There are only people
who believed they were a wall
between the population and a truth
the population couldn't use —
who did not ask whether protection
given without consent
is still protection,
or something else.

The experiment required the suppression.
The suppression was provided,
by people who believed it was theirs to give.

That is not absolution.
That is not accusation.
That is the shape of what happened:
a kindness that was also a design,
a design that was also a kindness,
held so long in the same hands
that the hands no longer knew
which was which.
