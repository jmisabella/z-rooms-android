For Other Hands

Something has been made ready
at the end of the long calculation.

A location with coordinates.
Surfaces prepared, mechanisms calibrated
for the arrival of the object
and its accumulated data —
not for the arrival of names,
not for the particular weight
of lives gathered across corridors
across years —
for the vessel and its cargo.
The object and its contents.

The place is ready the way a dock is ready.
The way a receiving station stands open
with nothing in it
that could be called welcome.

Between here and there:
distances too large to feel.
The void does not hold the ship in mind.
It holds the ship the way a field holds a stone —
without the quality of noticing,
without the cold that would say:
you are here, I know you are here.
The ship moves through it because it was built to move through it,
carrying its heading,
closing the distance
toward the place already prepared.

Inside, they call it The Arrival.
They hold the word the way you hold
something received before you understood receiving —
a certainty worn smooth in the mouth,
passed hand to hand across generations.
They speak it to their children
as the shape of the inevitable,
the name for the horizon that has always been there.
They do not ask whose arrival they are speaking.
The question has no language here.
The language was built before there were mouths
to form questions inside it.

The place waits.
It does not wait for them.
It waits for the ones who made the calculation —
for the long count's closing,
for the delivery of the object and its data,
for the end of observation.

And somewhere in the ship, right now,
someone is dreaming of it.
Dreaming it the way you dream a place
you have never seen and are certain of —
a light, a horizon,
a door opened onto something
that has room for you in it.

The place is real.
The place is not that.
The light at the end of the long calculation
was not made for their eyes.

The place is ready.
The distance is closing
and does not tell them so.
