The Record

There is no one to write to.

This is known before sitting down,
before the first word —
no authority within reach,
no open channel through the void,
no hands at the other end of this
that could receive it and do something.

She writes anyway.

She is an archivist.
The truth happened. It has dimensions —
dates, cross-references, the documented shape
of something real — and a thing that happened
and is not recorded
is a thing the archive does not hold.

The archive was built to hold things.

She places this in it.
She writes with the care
she would give any record —
precise, exact, the correct format,
the proper fields filled,
nothing approximate.

This is not protest.
This is not a message.
This is a record, composed for no audience,
addressed to the climate-controlled dark,
to the system that will verify and cross-reference
and file it, as it files everything,
as it was built to do.

The builders of this system
needed their records kept.
They built the resistance to erasure —
physical and digital, each the other's proof —
for the long patience of their experiment
running in these same halls,
this same dim archive
where the paper smells of settled decades
and the system runs
whether or not anyone is watching.

She is using their system
the way it was meant to be used.
Except for what she is placing in it.

She does not think: now they will know.
She does not think: now it can change.
She does not think: now I can rest.

She thinks: it will be here.
Exact. Patient.
In the climate-controlled dark
where things persist.

The indelibility was theirs.
They built it for their purposes —
to hold the data of their long observation,
to preserve what they intended to retrieve —
and did not think through
what else it guaranteed.

The experiment was designed to observe and record.

The observed records back.
