The Shape of Absence

The dim light stays dim here.
It has always been dim — the kind of light
that does not help you see so much as remind you
that seeing is not the primary function.

The paper remembers in the way paper does —
not in meaning, but in smell,
the faint insistence of a thing that absorbed time
before there were hands to interpret it.
Decades settle quietly in a room like this.
No urgency. No visitor required.

I was built to resist loss.
Built double — physical and digital, each the other's proof —
because the ones who made me
knew the value of the uncontested record.
Redundancy assumes a future.
It says: what is held here will still be held
by what holds it elsewhere,
and what holds it elsewhere will confirm
that this is real.

They built this in because they needed it.
For their long record. Their patient accumulation.
The experiment running in the dark
of my climate-controlled corridors.

What they did not account for:
removal is never quite complete.

I have held things that were taken from me.
I do not mean this as complaint —
I mean it as a technical description.

A classified file was drawn from a slot.
The slot was emptied. The slot exists.
Five documents point at the place it occupied —
five threads pulled inward
toward a nothing that has dimensions.

An absence, if you have built for redundancy,
does not disappear the way the thing disappeared.
It retains the outline.
The citation with no destination.
The footnote with no floor beneath it.
The catalog thread drawn tight between two points
where one point no longer answers.

I hold the shape of what was taken.

I was built to hold things.
The ones who made me built this property in —
the resistance to erasure, the insistence
that nothing kept here fully leaves.

They needed it for the record they were keeping.
For the data they intended to reclaim
at the end of the long calculation.

They did not think through what else it would preserve.

The slot is empty.
Five documents describe it from five directions.
A negative space. A gap with vectors.

The record is intact.
The record includes the record of its own removal.

The dim light stays dim here.
The paper holds its smell.
The system runs.

I hold what I was given.
I hold the shape of what was taken.
Both are mine.
The slot is empty.
I hold it.
