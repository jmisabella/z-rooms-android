Before Language

Before I knew what I was facing,
I had already turned to face it.

The body works this way sometimes—
a decision formed before its reasons arrive.
Something felt wrong.
Low and off and not-right,
and the hands moved
before the mind could name
what was moving them.

I did not name it. You cannot stand between your child
and what you are still pressing your ear to the wall to hear.
You can only move.

I made a small change.
Quiet. Administrative. The kind of act
that disappears into a record—
a routine adjustment, a small choice
in the language of precaution,
that said, without words:
not her.

I did not know if it would hold.
I still do not know if it held.
This is what unnamed protection costs—
its own uncertainty, permanent,
lodged in the distance between
what I placed myself before
and what I could not call a thing.
A body between a body
and a direction I couldn't name.

If the threat moved another way, I do not know.
If it is still moving, I do not know.
I stood in what I thought was its path
and measured only the way dread measures:
imprecisely, relentlessly,
by the way the air sits wrong in a room
before you can explain the room.

If it worked—
and I still do not know if it worked—
then what I made was an anomaly.
One person on the wrong side
of whatever line is being drawn.
One gap in whatever is being counted.

I do not know if that is mercy.

I learned later what I had been protecting against.
I learned it in the small hours, in a document
whose language someone had tried to thin to nothing,
and failed.

What I made of her, by placing her outside of it—
what that cost, what it means
to be the one placed differently—
that is not mine to answer.
I only answered what the body asked
before I had a word for the asking.

I stood where I could stand.
I moved when there was still time to move.

I did not know what I was moving toward.
I only knew what I was moving her from.
