CHAPTER ONE


She had walked the Nave ten thousand mornings, or near enough that the number had stopped meaning anything. The corridor ran the ship's full length and she knew every meter of it the way she knew her own hands — not by looking but by having always known, by being a person for whom this was simply the shape of the world.

The Nave in the morning was a particular thing. Not crowded but occupied: shifts changing, people moving toward their designations, the quiet business of the Aphelion's population conducting itself as it always had. She recognized more faces than she knew well, which was the condition of ship life — you could spend a lifetime among the same people and still know only a handful of them truly. Proximity and familiarity were not the same thing.

The light did what it always did in the morning cycle: a slow upward shift from the dimmer tone that passed for night into something that approximated warmth. She had been told, in the way children on the Aphelion were told such things, that this was the Architects' gift — a daily rhythm to anchor the body's sense of time. As was given. The phrase had been in her mouth since childhood and she had not thought about it in years.

Midway along the Nave she saw Fen.

She couldn't have said what made her look. It wasn't anything dramatic — not a sound, not a collision, not the kind of disturbance that draws eyes. Just a shift at the edge of her attention, a small wrongness in the ordinary, and her gaze moved.

Fen was someone she could put a name to without being able to say how well she knew her. They'd shared meals in the Common over the years, exchanged words in passing. A familiar face — no more than that. The kind you accumulate over a lifetime of sharing walls with the same few thousand people. She was somewhere in her forties, or thereabouts. A technician of some kind.

She was moving differently than she should have been.

It was subtle enough that Calla couldn't have explained it plainly. Not stumbling, not distressed, nothing outwardly wrong. But Fen was moving with a purposefulness that didn't quite attach to anything visible — drawn in a direction that led nowhere Calla could account for, her gaze fixed on something that wasn't there. There was an uncanny quality to the movement, something animal in it, the way a creature follows a sound below hearing.

And then she was past, and Calla kept walking, and the moment dissolved into the ambient motion of the Nave the way such moments do.

She didn't think about it again.

The descent from the residential tier to the lower ship was its own reliable transition: sound receding, temperature dropping by a fraction that was probably imaginary, the smell of machinery and time thickening around her as she went down. Past maintenance access points and their faint chemical smell, past the narrowing that marked the boundary of the inhabited mid-tier and the purely functional space below. Down.

The Stacks had no windows, obviously — nothing on the Aphelion had windows, there was nothing worth looking at outside — but somehow the archive's particular dimness felt like a kind of weather. The overhead lighting was old and steady and did not approximate the morning's warmth. It simply illuminated. She preferred it.

She arrived to find Davan already at the primary intake desk, reviewing an entry queue with the methodical care she'd spent eighteen months trying to instill in him. He looked up when she came in.

"Queue is normal," he said, which was how he reported it every morning. "Two physical retrievals requested, both on the older end. I pulled the rack locations."

"Good." She set down what she was carrying and looked at the queue herself, though she trusted his read. Habit. "Any discrepancies?"

"Not yet." He said this with a slight self-consciousness that meant he had not yet checked thoroughly enough to be certain. She didn't call it out. It would take him another year before routine became second nature and he stopped announcing things before he'd fully done them.

She let him continue the intake work and moved deeper into the Stacks, into the rows of physical holdings that occupied the far wall — actual printed records, sealed, tagged, stored in conditions that the Architects had specified and the Continuance had maintained without deviation ever since. The archive held both: physical and digital, each the other's verification. She'd explained to Davan early in his training that the redundancy was the point. Any system could fail. No two systems failed the same way at the same time.

"The Architects built in the redundancy deliberately," she'd told him, and he'd nodded with the earnestness of someone newly initiated into a reverence he didn't yet fully feel. She had not told him what she sometimes thought privately: that redundancy also meant it was harder to erase something completely. That whoever had designed the archive this way — whatever their intentions — had made accidental preservation a structural feature of the system.

She worked through the morning the way she always did: steady, unhurried, attending to the work as though it mattered, which it did, which was perhaps the thing she liked most about the Stacks — here, things could be verified. A record either matched its reference or it did not. A date was either accurate or it wasn't. In a world where most things resisted that kind of clarity, the archive was a comfort.

Davan came to her mid-morning with a question about retirement protocol — how to handle a record that had reached the end of its retention period but carried a flag he didn't recognize. She looked at the flag with him, and when she saw it — a Continuance marking, old, standard — she felt nothing particular.

"Leave it flagged," she said. "Continuance-marked records don't follow standard retention. They age independently."

"What does that mean, age independently?"

"They stay until someone with Continuance clearance decides they don't." She said this without inflection, because it was simply the shape of the rule, and Davan wrote it down.

She surfaced from the Stacks in the late afternoon, into the relative brightness of the mid-tier corridors, and made her way across the ship to her mother's quarters.

Lisel's door was the kind of door you knocked on even though you didn't have to. Calla knocked.

"It's open."

It was always open. Lisel had spent so many years keeping her door accessible for the various people of the ship who needed her at odd hours that the habit had calcified into default. Calla entered.

The quarters were warmer than her own — not in temperature, the Aphelion kept everything regulated, but in some quality of accumulation: objects that had been in the same places for so long they'd become part of the room's identity. A ceramic cup that Calla had given her mother perhaps fifteen years ago, still in use. A small mat of engineered plants under the desk lamp, dark-leafed and living. Photographs — printed, physical, preserved in the Aphelion's style — of people across Lisel's long career.

Her mother was sitting in the chair she always sat in, a data tablet in her hands that she set aside when Calla entered.

"You look tired," Lisel said by way of greeting.

"I'm not tired."

"You look it anyway."

This too was ritual, and Calla sat across from her in the second chair, which was less comfortable than it appeared and which she had been sitting in her whole life. The ease with which she settled into it was its own kind of knowledge.

They talked the way they usually talked: the shape of the day, small observations, nothing requiring resolution. Lisel had been in medical all shift — the Aphelion's clinic occupied a different wing of the mid-tier, and she'd been on her feet for hours. She mentioned this without complaint, which was her mode. The work was the work.

"One of my regulars has been having trouble sleeping," Lisel said, at some point in the middle of things, the way she occasionally mentioned patients — obliquely, without names, careful about what she shared. "Restless. Can't settle."

"They've been in to see you about it?"

"A couple of times now. It's probably nothing — the cycles affect people differently, some people are more sensitive." She picked up the ceramic cup, found it empty, set it down again. For a moment she seemed to listen to something distant — her gaze drifting elsewhere, as though catching a sound just below hearing — then she was back. "I've seen it before. Still."

"Still," Calla agreed, which was the correct response to the tone of a medical worker saying something like that.

They talked for another while. Eventually Calla rose, and Lisel rose too, and they stood near the door in the way that families do when a visit is ending and no one is in a particular hurry but the visit is ending nonetheless.

"Come again soon," Lisel said, which she always said.

"In a couple of days," Calla said, which she always said.

They held each other briefly, and Calla left.

She went back down to close out the day.

This was a habit she'd had since early in her career — returning to the Stacks at the end of the shift, when Davan had already gone and the archive was hers alone. Not to work in any substantial way, just to finish things properly. To review what had been done, file what had been started, leave the Stacks in a condition she'd be able to return to. She found that her mind settled in the quiet, in the dim and unvarying light, in the smell of old documents and the steady hum of the environmental systems. It was a form of daily accounting.

She was working through the final entries on the intake queue — verifying that Davan's morning processing matched the physical records as it should — when she pulled a holdings document for cross-reference and found the date.

She looked at it for a moment.

It was a small thing, the kind of thing that appeared in any large archive with any age on it: a record whose internal timestamp was slightly off from the indexed date, a discrepancy of a few cycles in what should have been a simple date of entry. She had found hundreds of similar errors over her career — accumulations of time, transcription mistakes, the inevitable small imperfections of a system maintained by human hands across generations. There was always an explanation. Usually it took less than a minute to find.

She followed the cross-reference code embedded in the record, which should have taken her to the parent file.

The parent file did not exist.

Not corrupted, not missing in the way records sometimes went missing when physical damage had outpaced digital backup. Just absent. The code pointed to a location in the index and the location was empty. A ghost tag. As though the record had known it was supposed to refer to something and had retained the reference even after the something was gone.

What made her pause — longer than the emptiness alone warranted — was the location itself. The slot the code resolved to was a Continuance retention location — those records aged independently, outside standard protocol, persisting until someone with Continuance clearance decided otherwise. They did not simply disappear. Standard archive errors didn't reach them.

Whatever had occupied that slot hadn't aged out. Someone had decided it was gone.

She stood with the physical document in her hands and looked at the empty index return.

Then she filed the physical record back in its housing, noted the discrepancy in the day's log as routine — an unresolved cross-reference, to be followed up — and closed out the interface.

She gathered her things. The Stacks were quiet in the way they always were late in the shift, the environmental hum steady and even, the dim overhead light doing its simple work. She climbed back through the lower corridors, past maintenance, past the narrowing, back into the warmer tier.

On the Nave she walked home through the evening rhythm of the ship, the light shifting into its cooler evening tone. The corridor was less occupied now, the day's business concluded. Faces she recognized, none that required her to stop.

She thought briefly about what Lisel had said — the patient who couldn't settle — and then let the thought go, because Lisel had said it in the tone of something being mentioned rather than the tone of something requiring action. And she thought about the record with the absent cross-reference, in the methodical archivist's way of someone noting a task deferred rather than abandoned. She would find the explanation. These things always had explanations.

She reached her quarters. The door opened. Inside was the ordinary shape of her life: her things in their places, the light she preferred, the quiet she'd learned to call enough.

She did not think again about Fen, moving along the Nave that morning with that strange and purposeful pull, fixed on something that wasn't there.

She did not think about it because the moment had passed, as moments do, into the accumulation of a day that had asked nothing of her.

Nothing had broken yet.
