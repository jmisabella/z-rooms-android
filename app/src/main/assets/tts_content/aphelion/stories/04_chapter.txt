CHAPTER FOUR


She said the acknowledgment phrase at breakfast and this morning she did not hear it.

That was new in the other direction. For weeks it had sat in her mouth with a weight it hadn't previously had — the shell of ordinary habit cracking, a word becoming actual and strange. This morning it simply came and went, absorbed into reflex, unremarkable. She understood, watching it pass through her, that this was how it persisted for three generations. Not suppression. Not forgetting. The natural entropy of attention. You could only hold a thing in focus for so long before your mind incorporated it back into the ordinary and moved on. It had been designed to be said without hearing. She had been saying it without hearing for thirty-seven years.

She ate and watched the Common in the way she'd learned to watch in recent weeks — not focused, not unfocused, the diffuse awareness she usually reserved for archive work when something was present but she hadn't yet found its shape. At the end of her table a woman sat with her tray untouched, hands in her lap, eyes fixed at a point above the opposite wall. The expression was familiar now. The particular quality of interior distance. The attending to something that wasn't there.

She was not the only one in the Common who was not eating.

Calla finished her meal and left.

She opened the third document from the cluster while Davan processed intake on the floor above, his movements audible in the steady way she had learned to hear as ambient confirmation: work proceeding normally, nothing requiring her attention. She had noted in the night what she expected to find. The note-taking was deliberate — she'd developed the habit because it kept her from reading evidence she was already predisposed toward, from arriving at the record with a conclusion that shaped what she saw rather than following what was there. Let the mind walk the path first. Then see if the path exists.

The maintenance log was, on its surface, exactly what it appeared to be: a quarterly inspection report from the environmental systems team, dated eleven months ago within the eleven-day window, signed through the appropriate sub-designations and stamped with the usual formality. It documented a revised inspection schedule for the biological filtration modules — specific sections of the ship, the mid-tier residential belt, the Common's ventilation subsystem, the air processing units adjacent to the clinic. Precautionary, the document said. A new inspection frequency of four times the previous cycle. Additional monitoring attachment points specified at the sections named. The language said: heightened monitoring per operational directive.

She cross-referenced the operational directive citation.

The citation resolved to a Continuance record.

She sat with this for a long moment.

You revised the inspection schedule for biological filtration systems if you were worried about what those systems might be carrying. You increased monitoring frequency if you needed to watch for something. You attached additional sensors to the systems that processed the air that the population breathed — at the residential tier, at the communal eating space, at the clinic — if you expected to need to know what was happening in those systems, and when.

Whatever the signal had told them, it had told them to watch the air.

She set the document aside and opened the fourth: one of the two administrative communications. An internal memorandum routed to medical personnel under a health maintenance protocol designation — the kind of guidance that reached Lisel and her colleagues as a matter of course, unremarkable in the ordinary stream of administrative communication. She recognized the format. She had catalogued dozens of similar documents. They looked like guidance. They were read as guidance. No one thought much about them.

This one established a symptom categorization protocol. Cases presenting with disrupted sleep, perceptual disturbances — visual, auditory, or both — or behavioral irregularities not attributable to a diagnosed physical cause should be documented under a standard code and managed with rest and standard support. She recognized the code: the one applied to confinement fatigue, to light cycle disruption, to the accumulated ordinary strangeness of living without horizon or sky. The catch-all. The category that absorbed anything the system didn't want to look at too closely.

Any case requiring escalation should be routed to the administrative tier.

Not to the medical research division. The distinction was buried in the syntax, placed where readers moved past rather than through it. But routing medical cases away from the people qualified to investigate toward an administrative body was not guidance. It was a channel. It was a way of ensuring that whatever was being observed was observed by the Continuance, and not by anyone with the capacity to name what they were seeing.

She thought about Lisel saying: I requested guidance from administration. I was told to continue current protocols.

Current protocols. This protocol.

She closed the documents. Filed her notes in the same neutral language she had been using — documents reviewed, dates cross-referenced, citations non-resolving, work ongoing. The language of administrative routine. Nothing that could not plausibly be explained as routine.

Her hands were steady. This was something she had noticed about herself across recent weeks and had chosen not to examine. Whatever she felt about what she was finding, it was not happening in her hands.

Cassian was waiting when she surfaced.

Not at his upper workspace this time. He was standing in the middle of the main archive floor beside the physical audit materials, hands in his pockets — the posture she associated with him in informal mode, accessible, unhurried, the ease of a long relationship. He watched her come up from the deep archive and let her reach the floor before he spoke.

"I'd like a few minutes," he said. No qualifier, no light preamble.

She set down what she was carrying. "Of course."

He waited until she was still. "You've been spending considerable time below this week."

"The audit opened some threads. I've been running them down."

"I know." He said it without emphasis, which was somehow more significant than if he'd said it with any. Just a fact. Of course he knew — the Stacks had access logs and he had Continuance clearance to read them, and she had known this and written her entries accordingly, and none of that changed what it meant to hear it said plainly between them. "I want to ask you to be careful with what you find down there."

She waited.

"There are records in the deep archive that touch areas of significant sensitivity." He was choosing words with a care that was not his ordinary mode — he was usually easy and precise, the kind of man who said what he meant without visible cost. This was costing him something. "Not because the information itself is dangerous, necessarily. Because the management of that information is deliberate, and long-standing, and the stability it maintains is not abstract. It's what we live inside." He paused. "All of us. You included."

She held his gaze. Twenty-two years. He had guided her into this role, had recommended her for it, had been the most reliable professional relationship of her career — not because he had been easy but because he had been consistent, because she had never had occasion to look at him with the question she was looking at him with now.

She was looking at it now because she could feel the conviction underneath his words and it was real. That was the precise quality of what made it wrong. He believed what he was saying. He believed in the management of the information, in the stability it maintained, in the protection it provided. He had constructed himself around that belief across the span of his career, had carried it so long it had become structural, load-bearing. She could see all of it in the space of a sentence, and none of it told her what he knew or didn't know about the shape of what she'd found.

"I appreciate the caution," she said.

"I know you'll use your judgment." The warmth in it was genuine, which was the most unsettling thing about it. He had not become something other than himself. He was exactly himself, and that self was asking her to stop. "That's why I wanted to say it plainly. Before rather than after."

Before rather than after. She noted the phrasing without responding to it.

"I'll route anything sensitive through you," she said.

He nodded once — the nod of a man who had said what he came to say — and returned to the audit materials. She watched him go and then she turned to the remainder of the day's work and completed it without incident, in the steady methodical way she always did, and did not allow herself to think about what he had said until she was away from the Stacks entirely.

Six was the number Lisel named, and she said it without the careful medical language she usually used. She said it the way she said things she was still working through — plainly, without the professional scaffolding, just the bare statement of what she'd seen.

Six this week. Seven if she counted the one who had stopped coming in.

"He stopped coming in," Calla said.

"Four days now." Lisel held her cup without drinking from it. "The residential coordinator says he's at home. No complaints reported through standard channels. He's simply — not presenting." She was quiet for a moment. "I've had patients stop coming before. The quality of it is different. When people stop coming because they're improving there's usually some indication — a note, a word through the network, some acknowledgment of the relationship. He's just stopped. As though the appointment had ceased to exist for him. As though he had." She turned the cup. "He's fifty-three. He was describing lights in the wrong places. He was managing. And then he stopped."

The ventilation monitoring records. The symptom routing protocol. The channel that kept medical workers from asking the questions they were qualified to ask. She held all of it below the level of words.

"The administration guidance," she said. "Did you receive an update?"

"Current protocols are sufficient." Lisel quoted it in a flatness that was not her usual tone — not the flatness of accepted information but of information received and not fully absorbed, an answer that had stopped trying to account for the question. "I filed a second request two days ago."

They sat. The heating element cycled off and the room settled into the particular quiet of her mother's quarters — objects in their long places, the printed photographs, the dark-leafed plant.

Lisel turned her head toward the wall.

It lasted three seconds, perhaps four. Her gaze moved past Calla and fixed on the wall with a quality Calla recognized and could not name, not yet, not out loud. The careful attending. The interior distance. Then Lisel blinked and reached for the cup and said: "I'm tired. I need a proper rest shift."

"You should take one."

"Yes." She said it without hearing herself.

Calla looked at her mother's face and it was her mother's face — fully present, the clear steady attention she had always had, looking back at her with the ordinary warmth of decades. The moment already gone, absorbed, as moments were absorbed. The tired eyes of a medical worker on a long week. There was nothing she could point to. Nothing she could name without being wrong.

She rose and held her mother at the door and felt the familiar weight of her, and held on a breath longer than was usual before she stepped back.

"Come soon," Lisel said.

"In a couple of days," Calla said.

She did not check the archive log until she was home.

The quarters terminal had limited remote access — basic review, nothing she could modify from here. What it showed her were the access records: which files had been read, when, from which terminal.

The log entries she had made in neutral administrative language — documents reviewed, citations non-resolving, work ongoing — had been accessed twice in the hours she had been away from the Stacks. The terminal codes were not Cassian's workspace. Not Davan's intake desk. System-level credentials, the kind that did not advertise themselves in the ordinary way, the kind that meant either automated monitoring or someone with administrative access deep enough to move through the archive without leaving the ordinary marks of presence.

She sat with this.

She had known it was possible. She had written the entries in neutral language because she understood they might be read, had understood it as a structural fact, a consequence of working inside a system the Continuance oversaw. Understanding it as possibility and having it confirmed were different things. Confirmation had weight that possibility did not.

Before rather than after, he had said.

She closed the terminal. Outside her door the ship conducted its ordinary evening business — someone's door, footsteps receding, the low ventilation hum she had lived inside her entire life and no longer heard unless she listened for it. She sat and held what she knew, and what she now knew had a new shape.

They had been reading her logs. They knew she was following the thread. Whatever she found from here, she found with that knowledge underneath it — a floor that had shifted slightly, not cracked, not broken, but no longer entirely where she had placed her weight.

She thought about the biological filtration monitors and the symptom routing protocol and the man who had stopped coming to his appointments. She thought about her mother's face turning toward a wall that held nothing. She thought about Cassian standing in the middle of the archive floor, choosing words with visible cost, asking her with the warmth of twenty-two years to stop.

The thread was still there. She would go back down.

But she would write nothing more.
