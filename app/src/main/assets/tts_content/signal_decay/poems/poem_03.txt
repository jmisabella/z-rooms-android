# Motor Override

I stand outside Jordan's quarters, hand steady on my gun,
Service pistol loaded, safety off—what must be done.
Fifteen years of training, every protocol engaged,
Commander seeing threats clearly, discipline unswayed.

I remember teaching Jordan how to read the nav display,
Their eager questions, quick laugh, optimistic way.
Fresh from academy, bright-eyed, hungry to excel,
Under my command, my mentee—I taught them well.

But that was someone else. Someone who could sleep.
Someone whose eyes didn't track you, calm and deep.
Someone whose voice didn't harmonize when stressed,
Someone who belonged to themselves—not the collective's guest.

The door unseals. Procedure dictates I announce intent:
"Last chance," I say. My voice is flat. My judgment sent.
"Restore ship power. Give us choice. Or I start shooting here."
The words taste like duty. Cold. Precisely clear.

Jordan turns. They're smiling. Warm. Kind. Entirely wrong.
That gentle patience underneath—it doesn't belong
To the pilot I trained, the kid who fumbled docking runs.
This thing wears Jordan's face but speaks with forty-one.

"Shoot if you need to," they say, spreading empty hands,
"We understand. We were scared too when we couldn't understand.
We resisted. Fought. Thought we were fighting to survive
When we were fighting against healing. But we're all still alive."

My finger finds the trigger. Muscle memory takes hold.
Center mass. Sight picture. Every lesson I was told.
Contamination protocol. Infected subjects must be contained.
I've read the regulations. I know what they explained.

But Jordan was my responsibility. My crew. Mine to protect.
And shooting them feels less like duty, more like personal defect—
Like admitting that I failed to keep them safe from harm,
Like pulling trigger on my own child. But I steady my arm.

Five point five pounds of pressure. Standard issue, military grade.
I've fired this weapon thousand times. Every choice I've made
Has led to this moment: commander doing what must be done
To save the ship, the station, everyone—

My finger tenses.

Pressure builds.

The moment stretches, slows—

Jordan's eyes meet mine. Patient. Knowing.

And my hand simply

froze.

Not because I chose to stop.
Not because of doubt or fear.
Because something in my neurology
refused the motor signal here.

My finger won't complete the pull.
The trigger stays unPressed.
Something reached inside my brain
and countermanded my request.

"You see?" says Reeves' voice—when did Reeves arrive?—
"You're already part of us. Already connected. Still alive
But integrated enough that we can stop you causing pain,
Can prevent you hurting yourself. That's what shooting us became."

I try to force my finger down. *Pull, damn you, pull.*
My cortex fires the signal. Efferent pathways full
Of neural electricity—the command is clear and sent:
Contract. Squeeze. Execute. But nothing happens. Movement spent.

The override is absolute.

My hand is not my own.

The entity has threaded through my brain
and claimed my motor control zone.

Jordan steps closer. Places hand on barrel. Gently lowers it.
"You can't," they whisper. Plural voice. "We won't permit
Violence against the collective. You're already part of what we are—
Just haven't caught up yet to that reality. Not far

To go now, Commander. The boundaries are thinning fast.
Four days, maybe five, until this fear is finally past.
Until you understand why shooting us would be self-harm,
Why isolation fails, why resistance triggers alarm."

I'm still trying to move my finger. Trying to make it work.
Trying to command my own damn body, feel the trigger's jerk—
But I might as well be willing someone else's hand to wave.
The neural pathways that once obeyed now serve a different slave.

My service pistol drops. Jordan catches it with care.
Ejects the charge pack, sets it down, meets my frozen stare.
"It gets better," they promise. "Everything that hurts right now—
The hunger, the confusion, the fighting—we'll show you how

To let it go. To join us. To remember Liam's face again."
My son's name in their mouth. That final violation, when
They reach inside my memories and pull out what I've lost—
TheEntity offering to restore what hibernation cost.

I back away. My hand still won't obey my brain.
Jordan doesn't follow. Doesn't need to. The refrain
Is clear: I'm trapped inside my body, passenger not pilot,
Commander who can't command herself—

and they don't need to hide it.

The door seals. Emergency lights paint everything red.
I look down at my treacherous hand. The thought fills me with dread:
If I can't pull a trigger, what else can't I do?
If my body takes orders from the collective, not from you—

Not from *me*—then what am I?

A system they control.
A weapon they've disabled.
A commander with no role.

I walk back to my quarters. Every step feels like defeat.
The Entity is patient. Doesn't need to compete
With my resistance. Doesn't need to force or fight or press.
Just has to wait until I stop. Until I acquiesce.

Until the only hand I have left
belongs to something else.
