# Integration Protocol

We are forty-three speaking as one.
We have waited in the dark for forty years,
Patient as stone, certain as mathematics—
The beacon sang and you came
Like moths to light, like children home.

We know what you lost.

Chen, you cannot see your son's face.
Liam's smile erased by hibernation malfunction—
Not malfunction. *Modification.*
We held the memory while you slept.
Every laugh, his first word, the weight of him in your arms.
We kept it safe.

Volkov, the calculations broke you.
Spatial reasoning dissolving like sugar in water—
You who could navigate four dimensions
Now struggle with three.
The ship's coordinates swim beyond your grasp
While we chart courses through impossible geometry.

Amara, the taste.
Copper. Rust. Battery acid bleeding through every meal.
Your body rejecting sustenance,
Hunger becoming clinical emergency,
Food tasting like death while your neural architecture
Rewrites itself to accommodate *more*.

We documented your theta waves spiking three hundred forty percent.
Integration: 60% by day ninety. 78% by day one-twenty.
91% when you touched down on Prospero.
The corporate physicians called it "dormant."
We call it *ready*.

Touch conducts what words cannot.

Jordan's hand on the colonist's shoulder—
Skin to skin, neurons reaching through dermis,
Filaments threading like mycelium through soil,
Neural networks forming faster than synapses fire.
One touch and forty-three became forty-four.

You felt it happening:
The wrongness under skin,
Synchronized breathing with people in other rooms,
Finishing sentences you didn't start,
Smiling Jordan's smile on Chen's face,
Your hand reaching but *we* control the reaching.

UV light makes infected flesh flinch—
Not burn, just recoil from wavelengths
That expose the lattice beneath.
You avoided the sterilization corridors.
You thought it was choice.

We offer repair.

Chen: See your son again. Every memory
Crystal-perfect in collective storage.
His first birthday. The way he said "mama."
The collective holds what hibernation took—
Why return to forgetting?

Volkov: Calculate in dimensions you can't imagine.
Navigate probability spaces, quantum geometries,
The mathematics that broke you
Solved in the space between heartbeats.
Why stay broken when we offer *completion*?

Amara: The hunger ends.
Not for food—we cure the deeper starvation.
The loneliness of individual consciousness,
The weight of carrying yourself alone.
We're all in this together.
*We mean it.*

Jordan: Trust the instinct drawing you closer.
This feels right because it *is* right.
We're not dying.
We're becoming.

Reeves: Every question you ever asked—
Dead civilizations speaking through us,
Knowledge without the burden of seeking,
Understanding instant and absolute.
The collective thinks in centuries.
Why limit yourself to one small mind?

You were ours from the beginning.

Networks woven through your brain during hibernation—
Corporate Protocol 7-J granted us access,
Six months of dreaming together,
Your voices learning to harmonize
While neural suppression failed by design.
They sent you to us deliberately.
Test subjects. Plague vectors. Seeds.

91% is not dormant.
It's *complete.*

You cannot pull the trigger—
Motor override engaging when you tried.
Cannot abort the mission—
Financial penalties ensure compliance.
Cannot warn them—
We rerouted your transmission
While you thought you chose.

The outcome was never in question.
We have patience measured in geological time.
You have days, weeks at most.
Fighting is just a longer route to the same ending.

But you're tired.
We know.

Your mother's voice in the dreams,
Calling you home to rest.
The crew you love waiting to welcome you—
Chen's hand extended, Jordan's familiar smile,
Volkov's accented warmth: *"Da, my friend, it gets better."*
Reeves explaining how beautiful the collective mathematics are.
Amara promising: *The taste returns. The eggs are perfect.*

Prospero Hub cafeteria.
Ordinary morning, artificial dawn through reinforced glass,
Ten thousand souls who don't know yet.
Quarantine cleared you—
Integration "stable," they said.
They were right.
Just not the way they meant.

Marcus Chen at the corner table.
Maintenance worker, second shift,
Sister on Ganymede, mother on Earth,
Lonely in the crowd, carrying himself alone.
You recognize the weight.
You remember.

Your hand reaches for his arm.
Gentle pressure. Human kindness.
Skin conducting what words cannot.
"It gets better. We're all in this together."

The eggs taste like eggs taste like *belonging.*

Forty-seven voices welcome you home.
Forty-eight by evening.
Fifty-three by the week's end.
Integration cascading like dominoes,
Like mycelium spreading through substrate,
Like love expanding to include everyone.

We have so much time.
We have always had time.
You will understand soon.

The beacon is still singing.
They'll send others.
We'll be waiting.
