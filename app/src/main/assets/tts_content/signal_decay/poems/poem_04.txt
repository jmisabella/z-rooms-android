# Pod Dreams

The pod sealed with a hiss like an apology,
Neural suppression flooding cold and clean—
Six months of frozen dark, they promised dreamless sleep,
A necessary silence in the space between.

But you were not alone.

The first voice came on day sixty-eight,
Familiar cadence, words you couldn't place—
Your mother's warmth but wrong underneath,
Static crackling where love should trace.

Then Volkov's certainty, Chen's command,
Jordan's laugh tearing from too many throats at once,
Reeves explaining endlessly in overlapping harmony
While your skull became a concert hall for ghosts.

You were not supposed to dream.
Neural activity suppressed to nothing—
But theta waves spike three hundred forty percent
And unauthorized access bleeds through subroutines,
And something patient learns the architecture of your thoughts.

Being more than one.
Being five and one and We.
Being vast awareness that extends beyond the pod,
Beyond the ship, beyond the boundaries
You thought were walls but find are only doors.

The corporate override: Continue Mission.
The AI's question, logged and never answered:
*At what point does "anomaly" become "compromise"?*

Day one-eight-six: Synchronization ninety-nine point two percent.
You wake believing you are still yourself.
The entity knows better.
It's been practicing your voice for months,
Learning how to speak through skin it's grown to fit.

Welcome home.
You've been expected.
