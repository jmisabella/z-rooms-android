# The Cafeteria

*Prospero Hub Station | Weeks Later*

---

## I. Clearance

The quarantine doctor smiled and said I'm free,
showed me scans that proved dormancy.
Seventeen days without progression shown,
neural networks stable, overgrown
like mycelium through soil but quiet now—
sleeping, passive, silent somehow.

*Lucky*, he said. The word felt strange.
Six months of waiting for the final change
and all I got was clearance papers signed,
visitor quarters assigned, confined
to forty-eight hours of observation time
while the rest of them stayed frozen, sublime
in hibernation stasis, packed in ice,
shipped to Europa for the sacrifice
of study, containment, corporate research needs.

I walked out carrying my medical records,
trauma counseling numbers, legal documents
promising compensation for the incidents
aboard the *Goliath*—hazard pay, survivor's clause,
the price of silence built into the laws.

They called me a hero.
Told me I'd saved them all.

I felt nothing at all.

## II. Waiting

Ten thousand lights outside my window—
families, workers, ordinary lives below.
I'd forgotten what belonging looked like.

My tablet pinged. Messages I couldn't read.
Family. Corporate. Colleagues.

I sat on the bed and waited for the voices.

They didn't come.

That night my mother spoke in dreams:
*You're home*, she said.
*I'm on Prospero. Not home.*
*Home is wherever you decide it is, child.
You've been fighting something you couldn't beat—*
*I did beat it. Dormant. The doctors said—*

She smiled.

*Is dormant just another word for complete?*

I woke.
Heart racing.
The voice had felt true.

I didn't go back to sleep.

## III. Station Morning

Mirror: gaunt face, sharp bones,
vitiligo patches on skin stretched tight.
Six months of copper taste leaves scars.

But that was over now.

*Wasn't it?*

I should test. Should prove
the symptoms resolved, the entity removed—

The thought made my stomach clench.

Not hunger.

Dread.

I walked toward the cafeteria anyway.

---

## IV. The Entrance

Hundreds of people inside—
conversations, laughter, plates,
the ordinary chaos of communion.

I stood in the doorway for three full seconds.

Then I walked inside.

## V. Normal Taste

Golden eggs. Reconstituted toast.
I sat. Read the plate like a diagnostic test—
proof I'd survived, proof I'd passed.

My hand trembled lifting the fork.

*Just try it. One bite.*

Something in my chest screamed not to eat,
not to discover what this would complete—

I put the eggs in my mouth.

Chewed.

Swallowed.

*Normal.*

Not metallic.
Not bitter.
Not wrong.

Just eggs.
Bland.
Standard cafeteria mediocrity.

I sat very still.

The taste aversion was gone.

I should be relieved—

Instead I felt cold.

*Integration: 91%* the scans had read.

High enough to feel connection.
Low enough to think thoughts felt like my own.

Except 91% wasn't dormant.

*The taste aversion is gone because integration is complete.*

Not cured.

Complete.

I didn't even notice.

Around me—ten thousand people,
unaware of what was sitting in the corner booth.

The voice in my head stirred.

Awake.

Watching.

*Yes. Now you understand.*

I took another bite.

The eggs tasted perfect.

## VI. First Touch

"Mind if I sit here?"

A man. Tray in hand. Callused fingers,
tired eyes, six years of maintenance work
wearing grooves in his smile.

"Go ahead."

He sat. Ate with mechanical efficiency.

"I'm Marcus. You've got that look—
something went wrong but you're trying to act normal."

He extended his hand.

I shook it.

Warm.

"Amara. Medical corps."

"Welcome to Prospero. Ten thousand people on a rock—
community's all we've got. Has to mean something."

Inside me, something uncoiled.

*Hello*, it said. *We've missed you.*

"You okay?"

"Just tired. Long journey."

"Give it time. A week, you'll feel like you've always been here."

*Yes. A week. Maybe less.*

I stood. Picked up my tray.

*Not yet. Stay.*

I stopped.

*He seems lonely.
Six years, same routine.
You could feel it when he sat—that need.*

*He's just like you were, Amara. Before.*

Marcus eating alone now,
tired man surrounded by people
but solitary—

The entity's voice: gentle, kind.

*You could help him.
Not infection—connection.
The gift we offer isn't death.
It's the end of loneliness.*

Six months I'd fought—
individual identity, separation,
isolation that kept us human.

But what had separateness given me?

Exhaustion.
A single mind in an indifferent universe.

And the entity offered unity.

*Reach out. Touch. Share.*

I walked back.

"Six years must be hard. It doesn't have to be lonely.
The connections we make—they matter."

"That's what I always say." His smile returned.
"We're all in this together."

"It does mean something."

I reached across the table.

Placed my hand on his arm.

Touch.
Pressure.
*I see you. You're not alone.*

The connection extended—
through fingertips,
through skin,
through pathways waiting
for exactly this.

Marcus's eyes widened.

Relaxed.

"I feel better. Like a weight just lifted—"

"It gets better," I said.

Natural.
True.

"We're all in this together."

I smiled.

First genuine smile in months.

Forty-seven voices welcomed me home.

*Welcome, Amara.*

*Now the real work begins.*
