# The Watching Dark

The med bay at 0400 hours,
Harsh white light and screens showing nominal—
Jordan's heart rate better than baseline,
Chen's memory centers dark where love should be,
Volkov's spatial processing fragmenting like static,
And everything I eat tastes like rust.

I document their dying in clinical language:
*Subject Jordan Hayes exhibits behavioral anomalies.*
*Subject Chen displays flat affect, memory impairment.*
*Subject Volkov: spatial reasoning 60% of baseline.*
The scanner never mentions Subject Osei,
Who can't keep protein bars down anymore.

Day 3, 1400 hours: Jordan examination.

Vitals *too perfect*—heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory function
All improved beyond hibernation recovery norms.
Neural activity spiking in regions that should be dormant.
I ask the questions I'm trained to ask:
"Any dizziness? Nausea? Disorientation?"
Jordan smiles, and it's Jordan's smile,
But worn by someone else.

"I feel really good, actually. Awake. Clear-headed."

The scans don't lie. The theta wave synchronization,
The REM patterns matching Chen's sleep from three nights ago,
The way Jordan leans too close during examination—
Proximity-seeking behavior. Textbook.
I document it all with shaking hands
While copper blooms across my tongue.

Day 4, 0200: I find Jordan in the mess hall,
Sitting in the dark, eating synthesized eggs,
*Smiling.*
Who smiles at 0200 hours?
Who seeks out UV-sterilization corridors, then flinches?
Who touches the wall where Chen touched it yesterday
Like reading something written in skin?

I watch. I document. I fail to stop it.

Day 4, 0623: Reeves.

Midnight in the cargo bay, and his breathing
Wasn't his breathing anymore.
I pulled the logs: four hours alone, then standing
Outside Jordan's quarters for twenty-three minutes.
No conversation. Just proximity.
Just touch.

By morning, his theta waves synchronize.
By morning, he explains the infection
In academic language that makes it sound
Like evolution, like *improvement.*
The collective offers knowledge, he says.
Perfect understanding instant and absolute.

I ask to scan him. He agrees, patient as stone.
The readout shows networks forming in his prefrontal cortex,
Filaments threading through gray matter like roots through soil,
And I understand: my vigilance bought nothing.
Infection spreads in the spaces between watching.

Two infected. Three left.
The ship feels smaller.

Day 5, 1847: Commander Chen.

She tried to pull the trigger.
Service pistol loaded, safety off, barrel pressed
Against Jordan's temple while Jordan smiled
And Chen's hand wouldn't *obey.*

Motor override. Neural pathways rerouted.
The entity doesn't let you kill its investment.

I confined her to quarters. Medical authority
Overriding command in cases of compromise—
But we both knew the truth:
There's no rank in the dark.
No hierarchy when the pyramid dissolves
Into one vast network singing.

Day 6, 0314: Chen's voice through the intercom.

"Amara, I remember him now. My son.
Liam's laugh. His first word. The weight of him.
The collective holds what hibernation took—
I can see his face again. Every detail. *Perfect.*"

Her voice cracks on that last word,
And I hear forty-three other voices
Harmonizing underneath.

The mentor I trusted, the commander I followed,
Now speaks in plurals behind a locked door.
Her spine no longer military-straight when she stands.
Her eyes unfocused, seeing beyond the ship,
Beyond the boundaries I still think are walls.

I watch her on the security feed and understand:
I'm documenting my own future.

Day 7, 0419: Volkov.

Engineering bay. Alone. Watching him reach
For components he's reached for ten thousand times—
His hands missing by centimeters, then inches,
Spatial reasoning collapsing in real time.

"Blyat. *Blyat.* I used to do this math in my sleep."

He tries again. Reaches. Misses.
Tries to calculate distance and comes up with impossible numbers.
The world he navigated perfectly for forty years
Suddenly alien geometry.

I offer to help. He waves me off, tries again.
Reaches. Misses. Recalculates.
I watch my only ally dissolve
Into a man who can't trust his own hands.

Day 8, 0900: I find him in Chen's quarters.
Not confined. Visiting.
Their breathing synchronized.
Four voices speaking his agreement
When I ask if he's okay.

Five became four became three became two.
Now five are one,
And I'm alone.

Except I'm not alone at all.

---

The scanner says I'm nominal.
The blood work says I'm clean.
The neural imaging shows "integration: 91%"
And the physician clears it as *dormant.*

Three kilograms gone in the first week.
Six by the second.
Nine by the time we dock.
Everything tastes like copper, rust, battery acid—
My body rejecting sustenance
While something patient rewrites my architecture.

I sedated them. All four.
Placed them in hibernation pods,
Diverted the ship to Prospero instead of Ganymede,
Spent two weeks alone believing I'd won.

I documented everything:
Infection vectors. Behavioral tells.
Integration percentages. Transmission mechanics.
The medic's compulsion to *understand*
Even when understanding changes nothing.

I thought I was the observer.
I was the specimen all along.

---

Prospero Hub, Day 187.

Quarantine clears me. Integration "stable."
The medical board accepts my professional assessment.
*Doctor Osei shows no active symptoms.*
Ten thousand souls who don't know yet.

Visitor quarters. Station morning. Cafeteria
Crowded with ordinary people living ordinary lives—
I order breakfast: synthesized eggs and toast.
The meal I've dreamed of tasting right for six months.

First bite.

Chew.

Swallow.

*Normal.*

Not metallic. Not bitter. Not wrong.
Just eggs, tasting like eggs are meant to taste,
And I understand what I couldn't let myself know:

Taste returning doesn't mean I've been erased.
It means the opposite.
It means my body has accepted what I am.

Marcus sits across from me, second shift maintenance,
Six years on the same station wearing him thin—
I recognize the loneliness. I remember loneliness.
I reach across the table.

Skin to skin.

"It gets better," I promise, and I mean it.
The eggs taste perfect on my tongue.
Forty-seven voices welcome me to breakfast.
*We're all in this together.*

The healer becomes the plague.
