The House Remembers (3s)

The house at the end of Maple Street (2s)
has been empty for sixteen years. (3s)
No one will buy it. (2s)
No one will tear it down. (4s)

The windows are dark (2s)
but sometimes (2s)
on winter evenings (2s)
people swear they see a light (3s)
moving from room to room. (4s)

A candle maybe. (2s)
Or something that wants you (3s)
to think it's a candle. (5s)

The realtor doesn't mention (2s)
what happened in the kitchen. (3s)
Or the basement. (2s)
Or the small room (2s)
at the top of the stairs (3s)
with the door that locks from the outside. (5s)

She doesn't mention (2s)
the wallpaper in the master bedroom (3s)
that was changed four times (2s)
but the stains kept coming through. (4s)

Dark. (2s)
Spreading. (2s)
Shaped like hands. (5s)

The neighbors know (2s)
not to walk past after dark. (3s)
They cross the street. (2s)
They hurry. (3s)
They don't look at the windows. (4s)

Because sometimes (2s)
the windows look back. (5s)

Last month (2s)
a grad student (2s)
doing research on local history (3s)
asked to see inside. (3s)

The realtor said no. (2s)
Then she said (2s)
please don't ask again. (4s)

The student went anyway. (3s)
Alone. (2s)
At dusk. (3s)
With a camera. (4s)

They found the camera (2s)
three days later (2s)
on the front porch. (3s)
Placed neatly. (2s)
Deliberately. (4s)

Every photo was black. (3s)
Just darkness. (3s)
Except the last one. (4s)

In the last one (2s)
you can see something. (3s)
A figure. (2s)
Standing at the top of the stairs. (3s)
Pale. (2s)
Watching the camera. (4s)

And if you look closely (3s)
very closely (2s)
at the figure's face (3s)
you can see (2s)
it's smiling. (5s)

They never found the student. (4s)

But sometimes (2s)
late at night (2s)
people walking past the house (3s)
hear knocking. (3s)

From inside. (3s)

Frantic. (2s)
Desperate. (3s)
Getting weaker. (4s)

And then (2s)
it stops. (5s)

The house has been empty (2s)
for sixteen years. (4s)

At least (2s)
that's what they tell you. (4s)

But the house knows different. (3s)

The house knows (2s)
it's never really empty. (4s)

It just waits. (3s)

Patient. (2s)
Hungry. (3s)
Watching the street. (4s)

Waiting for someone else (3s)
to be curious. (3s)
To be brave. (3s)
To try the door. (5s)

The door (2s)
that's always unlocked. (4s)

The door (2s)
that opens so easily. (3s)

The door (2s)
that closes behind you (3s)
with a sound like a sigh. (5s)

And then (2s)
the house (2s)
remembers you too. (8s)
