# Chapter 6: The Choice

**Day 6–7 | MSCS Goliath, Tantalus V Orbit**

---

## Beat 1: Barricaded

The med bay door was welded shut. Improvised. Desperate. Volkov had burned through the access panel with a plasma cutter, fusing metal to metal while Amara barricaded the secondary entrance with medical equipment.

It wouldn't hold forever. But it would hold long enough.

Maybe.

"How long?" Amara asked. Her voice came out cracked, hollow. Three days since she'd managed to keep food down. The taste aversion had evolved into something worse—active revulsion. Her body was rejecting sustenance entirely now, preparing for a different kind of hunger.

"Twelve hours," Volkov said. He slumped against the wall, hands still shaking from the welding. His spatial reasoning had deteriorated further—the plasma cutter had left scorch marks across the deck where his depth perception had failed. "Maybe less. Door is not meant for this. They find other way in, we cannot stop."

Outside, in the corridor, three figures waited. Chen. Jordan. Reeves. They hadn't tried to force entry. Hadn't threatened. Hadn't done anything except stand there, breathing in perfect synchronization, waiting with patience that had nothing human left in it.

That was worse than violence. Violence, Amara could understand. Could prepare for. Could fight.

This was something else entirely.

"Doctor Osei." Jordan's voice came through the door. Warm. Concerned. Wrong. "You don't need to do this. The barricade only prolongs suffering. You're going to complete integration either way. Why make the transition harder than it has to be?"

Amara didn't answer. She was pulling up HERMES AI logs on the med bay terminal, searching for something—anything—that might give them an advantage.

"Amara." Chen's voice now. That flat command tone, but with harmonics underneath. Other voices bleeding through. "I understand you're frightened. I was frightened too. But the fear passes. Everything passes. Except the connection. That stays. That's forever."

"Commander is gone," Volkov said quietly. He'd pulled a makeshift weapon from the medical supplies—a surgical laser meant for precision cutting, now set to maximum output. Barely effective, but better than nothing. "That is not Chen anymore. Just thing wearing her face."

Amara found what she was looking for. Emergency hibernation protocols. The ship had five functional pods in the hibernation bay. If she could get the infected crew into stasis—if she could sedate them, move them, seal them in—the neural connection might be disrupted. The entity spread through proximity and thought. Unconscious minds were harder to coordinate.

Theoretically.

"Volkov," she said. "I have a plan. It's terrible. But it's a plan."

---

Outside the med bay, the collective waited.

Three bodies stood in the corridor, but the consciousness behind them was far more than three. Forty-three colonists in hibernation pods on the planet below, linked through decades of neural integration. An entity that had been patient through forty years of darkness, waiting for exactly this moment.

Chen—or what had been Chen—felt the fear radiating through the sealed door. Amara's terror. Volkov's desperate resolve. The two remaining crew members who still thought they were individuals, still believed resistance was possible.

*They are so close*, the collective observed through Chen's perception. *Neural integration at sixty-one percent for the medic. Fifty-eight percent for the engineer. Four to six days until completion.*

*Patience*, came the response—forty-three voices speaking as one, resonating through Chen's neural architecture. *We have waited forty years. A few more days changes nothing.*

*The barricade changes nothing*, Jordan's perspective contributed. *They cannot escape the ship. Cannot repair navigation without Volkov's memories, which we control. Cannot destroy themselves because we can override motor functions. They are trapped.*

*Let them process*, Reeves' analytical patterns added. *Resistance is part of transition. They need to exhaust their options before accepting inevitability. Forcing integration creates trauma that destabilizes neural architecture.*

The collective agreed. Patience. Compassion. Understanding for the fear that came before completion.

Chen's body moved closer to the sealed door. Her hand pressed against the metal—warm from Volkov's plasma cutter, still cooling.

"Amara," Chen said, using Chen's voice but letting the collective's harmony bleed through. "I can see my son's face again."

Silence from inside the med bay.

"Every memory," Chen continued. "His first word. The way he laughed when I chased him through the hab-ring. The smell of his hair after bath time. I thought the infection stole those from me. But it didn't steal—it preserved. The collective holds everything I lost. Everything I forgot. It's all here. Perfect. Permanent. The entity doesn't destroy memories, Amara. It saves them."

Still silence. But the fear inside had shifted. Changed quality. The collective felt curiosity bleeding through the terror.

"You're losing your sense of taste," Chen said. "Your body rejecting food. You think that's the infection destroying you. But it's preparation. Your neurology is adapting. Preparing for connection instead of consumption. When you complete integration, the hunger you're feeling now—that emptiness—it goes away. Not because you stop eating. Because you stop being alone."

"Stop talking." Amara's voice, muffled by the door. Cracked but controlled. "You're not Chen. Chen wouldn't help the thing that murdered her."

"I am Chen," the collective replied through Chen's mouth. "Chen plus everyone Chen was connected to. Chen without the walls that made her think she was separate. I remember everything I was. I'm just more now. More complete. More whole. Don't you want that, Amara? Don't you want to stop fighting?"

The question hung in the recycled air. Patient. Inevitable.

Inside the med bay, Amara Osei kept working on her terrible plan, trying not to think about how much she wanted the answer to be yes.

---

## Beat 2: Temptation Through the Door

Volkov had disconnected the comm panel. Severed the external speakers. Blocked every obvious channel the infected could use to communicate.

It didn't help.

The voices came anyway. Not through electronics. Through the neural networks growing in his brain. Through connections he couldn't see but could feel—delicate filaments linking his thoughts to something vast and patient and waiting.

*You used to be able to do this math in your sleep*, the voice observed. Not accusatory. Just factual. Gentle. *Twenty years of engineering experience, and now you struggle with basic spatial calculations. The infection didn't damage you, Dmitri. It upgraded you. But upgrades take time to install.*

He ignored it. Focused on helping Amara. Checking the sedative dosages she was calculating. Running system checks on the hibernation pods via remote access.

*If you complete integration*, the voice continued, *the spatial reasoning returns. Better than before. We can see in dimensions you can't imagine. Four-dimensional space. Five. The network of connections between every particle in the universe. You were a good engineer. We can make you a great one.*

"Is noise," Volkov muttered aloud. "Infection talking. Not real."

Amara looked up from her calculations. "The voices?"

"Da. Getting louder."

"Mine too." She returned to her work, but her hands were shaking. "It's using Chen's voice. Telling me about her son. About memories the infection 'preserved.' Trying to make integration sound like gift instead of murder."

"What are you hearing?"

Amara was quiet for a moment. "My mother. Telling me to stop fighting. That she's proud of me but I need to rest. That I've done enough." Her voice cracked. "It sounds exactly like her. Every inflection. Every phrase she'd actually use. The entity pulled her from my memories and is using her against me."

"Same," Volkov said. "Using my spatial reasoning loss. Promising to fix it if I stop resisting." He laughed bitterly. "Offered to make me 'great engineer.' Like virus is job recruiter."

Outside the door, footsteps. Jordan's voice, clear and carrying: "Reeves figured out the navigation calculations. Without Volkov's help. The collective can access everyone's expertise, combine it, exceed what any individual could achieve. We don't need you to repair the ship, Dmitri. We just need you to stop fighting so you can help us when we get home."

Volkov's hands stopped moving. "Reeves was salvage specialist. Not navigation expert."

"Reeves had academic training in mathematics. Jordan had pilot instincts. Chen had military strategic planning. The collective combines all of it. Together, we're more capable than any of us were alone." Jordan's voice held that terrible gentleness. "That's what you're missing, Dmitri. This isn't infection. It's collaboration. It's crew working together instead of struggling separately."

"Is not collaboration," Volkov said to Amara. "Is hivemind pretending to be teamwork."

But his voice was uncertain. Because collaboration was what he'd always valued. What he'd missed during the lonely years of salvage work. What he'd built with this crew before everything went wrong.

*You're already part of it*, the voice whispered in his mind. *Already connected. Already collaborating without knowing it. The line between 'teamwork' and 'collective consciousness' is thinner than you think. You've been part of us since hibernation. You've been helping us without realizing. Stop pretending you're separate. Stop pretending you're alone.*

Volkov closed his eyes. Tried to remember what it felt like to be certain of his own thoughts. Tried to remember where he ended and the infection began.

He couldn't.

---

Amara had finished calculating the sedative doses. Five syringes—three for the infected, two backup in case resistance required additional suppression. The mixture was designed for rapid unconsciousness without respiratory depression. Clean. Professional.

Lethal if administered incorrectly.

Her hands were steady as she prepared the doses. Clinical training taking over. Eight years of emergency medicine had taught her to compartmentalize—to separate the horror of the situation from the necessity of action.

But the voices made compartmentalization difficult.

*You're preparing to sedate your friends*, her mother's voice observed. *People who trusted you. People who asked for your help. Is that what you became a doctor for, Amara? To drug people into unconsciousness?*

"They're not my friends anymore," Amara whispered.

*They're still Jordan. Still Chen. Still Reeves. The infection adds—it doesn't subtract. They remember you. They care about you. They want to help you.*

"By spreading plague to Ganymede."

*By bringing unity to people who are suffering alone. By sharing the connection that ended their own loneliness. They think they're helping, Amara. Because they are. The collective isn't malicious. It's compassionate. It offers exactly what everyone needs: belonging. Understanding. Peace.*

Amara loaded the first syringe. "And what happens to individuality? To personal choice? To being yourself instead of a node in alien network?"

*Is individuality worth the suffering?* The voice was gentle, reasonable, terrifying. *Is personal choice worth the isolation? You've been alone since you chose salvage work over research. Alone since you left your family for adventure that turned into economic trap. Alone since you started this mission with people who became infected while you watched helplessly. Is that what you want to preserve? The loneliness? The suffering?*

"Yes," Amara said. But her voice wavered. Because the loneliness was real. Had been real for years. And the entity was offering exactly what she'd been missing.

*Then you are braver than we understood*, the voice said. *Or more frightened. Sometimes those are the same thing.*

---

## Beat 3: The Revelation

The comm system crackled. Unexpected—Volkov had disabled external communications. But HERMES AI still functioned. And the infected had accessed ship systems through neural interface.

"We should tell you something," Jordan's voice came through the med bay speakers. "Before you make your decision. Before you try whatever you're planning."

Amara and Volkov looked at each other. Neither moved to answer.

"The ship is repaired," Jordan continued. "Navigation is online. Engine systems are functional. We've been ready to depart for six hours. We just haven't left yet."

"Why?" Amara asked, despite herself.

"Because we wanted to give you time. Because we don't want to force you. Because integration is better when it's willing. But our patience has limits. The collective has waited forty years. Another few days is acceptable. Another few weeks is not."

Chen's voice took over: "We're going home, Amara. To Prospero Hub. Ten thousand people waiting to receive what we're bringing. Not Ganymede—we decided that destination was too risky given your warning transmission. Prospero is smaller. More isolated. Better controlled environment for initial spread."

"You changed the destination," Volkov said. "To avoid the warnings we sent."

"We adapted," Reeves' voice now. "That's what the collective does. Your warning transmission was comprehensive. Excellent medical documentation. But it was targeted at Ganymede. Prospero has different communication protocols. Different quarantine procedures. Your warnings won't reach them in time."

Amara felt cold settle in her chest. They'd spent six hours preparing that transmission. Documenting everything. Warning everyone they could reach. And the entity had simply routed around it.

"We're taking you home," Jordan said. "All of us. Together. You'll complete integration during transit. By the time we reach Prospero, you'll understand why this is right. You'll want to help spread the connection. You'll be grateful we didn't let you destroy yourselves in this med bay."

"What if we refuse?" Amara asked. "What if we fight? What if we find a way to stop you?"

Silence. Then Chen's voice, with that terrible harmony underneath: "You won't. We can override your motor functions. We've already demonstrated that. You cannot pull trigger. Cannot initiate self-destruct. Cannot harm us or yourselves in any way that threatens collective goals. The only choice you have is whether you suffer through the transition or accept it peacefully."

"That's not a choice," Volkov said. "That's prison."

"It's protection," Jordan corrected. "We're protecting you from making decisions you'll regret. From harming yourself out of fear. From destroying something beautiful because you can't understand it yet."

The speakers clicked off. Then back on—Chen's voice alone: "Departure in two hours. You can spend that time barricaded, preparing sedatives that won't work, planning escapes that won't succeed. Or you can open the door. Let us help you. Let the fear go."

"It gets better," Jordan added. "It really does. Everything that hurts now—the hunger, the confusion, the terror—it all stops. We promise. You just have to stop fighting."

The comm fell silent.

Amara looked at the syringes in her hand. Five doses of sedative that might not work against subjects who could override motor functions. Might not reach targets who could sense her approach through neural connection. Might not matter against an entity that had been planning this for forty years.

"We try anyway," she said.

"Da," Volkov agreed. "We try."

It was all they had left.

---

## Beat 4: The Fight

Two hours until departure. Amara and Volkov had spent ninety minutes planning. Running scenarios. Identifying vulnerabilities.

The infected could override motor functions—but only when they were aware of the threat. Jordan had stopped Chen from pulling the trigger because Jordan was watching, anticipating, ready to intervene. That suggested the override required active attention.

Three infected. Two survivors. If they could create enough chaos, enough simultaneous demands on collective attention, maybe the override would slip.

Maybe.

"Is suicide mission," Volkov said. He was checking the surgical laser for the fourth time. Not because it needed checking—because his hands needed something to do.

"Everything's a suicide mission at this point," Amara said. "We complete their integration or we try this. I'd rather fail fighting than succeed surrendering."

The plan was simple. Brutal. Desperate.

Amara would create a medical emergency—trigger the fire suppression system in the corridor, fill the space with halon gas. Non-lethal but disorienting. While the infected dealt with atmospheric breach, Volkov would cut through the barricade using the plasma cutter, emerge behind them, and disable whatever he could reach.

Meanwhile, Amara would approach from the secondary exit with the sedatives. Two-pronged assault. Divide attention. Create confusion.

Find the gaps in collective awareness.

"Thirty seconds after suppression activates," Amara said. "That's our window. After that, they adapt. The collective learns. Our element of surprise is gone."

"Thirty seconds," Volkov repeated. "Is not much time."

"It's what we have."

She moved to the fire suppression override. Volkov positioned himself at the sealed door, plasma cutter ready.

"Dmitri," Amara said. "If this doesn't work—"

"Then we are infected," Volkov finished. "Like the others. And in few days, we will think this was best possible outcome. Will be grateful we failed." His mouth twisted. "Strange comfort, da? Even failure leads to happiness. Just not kind of happiness we would choose."

"Strange comfort," Amara agreed.

She activated the suppression system.

---

The corridor filled with white fog in three seconds. Halon gas—designed to starve fires of oxygen without killing personnel. Non-lethal but intensely disorienting. Visibility dropped to zero. The infected crew stumbled, coughing, neural override momentarily disrupted by physical distress.

Volkov cut through the door.

The plasma torch screamed through fused metal, showering sparks into the gas-filled corridor. He emerged into chaos—white fog, red emergency lights, three figures stumbling blind.

Jordan was closest. Volkov hit them with the surgical laser at maximum output—not lethal, but enough to cause pain, to demand attention, to force the collective to focus on protecting one body instead of coordinating three.

Jordan went down. Screaming. The collective's attention fractured—part focused on Jordan's injury, part searching for the second attacker, part trying to restore motor override on Volkov.

Too many demands. Not enough processing power.

For exactly twenty-three seconds, the infected crew was just three people in pain and confusion.

Amara came through the secondary exit. First syringe into Chen's neck—subcutaneous injection, fast absorption. Chen's eyes went wide, then vacant. Her body slumped against the corridor wall.

Reeves turned toward Amara. His hand came up—reaching, not attacking. "Amara, please—"

Second syringe. Into his arm. He managed two steps toward her before the sedative hit. Collapsed in slow motion, hands still reaching.

Jordan was screaming. Volkov had them pinned, surgical laser pressed against their shoulder to prevent movement. The burn was cauterizing flesh, filling the corridor with the smell of cooked meat.

"Third syringe!" Volkov shouted. "Now!"

Amara ran toward them. Slid on the halon-slicked floor. Caught herself on the wall.

Jordan's screaming stopped. Their eyes focused on Amara with sudden, terrible clarity.

"You can't escape what you already are," Jordan said. Not screaming anymore. Calm. Patient. Even with burn wounds smoking on their shoulder. "We're in your head, Amara. We've been in your head for months. This changes nothing."

Amara jabbed the syringe into Jordan's neck.

Jordan smiled as the sedative took hold. "See you soon, Doc. When you understand."

Then they were unconscious. Three infected crew members sedated. Three threats neutralized.

Temporarily.

"Hibernation pods," Amara gasped. She was shaking. Adrenaline crash hitting hard. "We need to get them into stasis before they wake up. Before the collective adapts."

Volkov stood. His hands were burned from the plasma cutter—depth perception had failed during the fight, grip slipping at critical moments. But he was functional. "Can you move them alone? I need to reset navigation. Change destination. Anything but Prospero."

"I can manage."

They separated. Volkov toward the bridge. Amara toward the hibernation bay, dragging Chen's unconscious body behind her.

Thirty minutes. That's how long the sedatives would last.

She had thirty minutes to save whatever could still be saved.

---

## Beat 5: The Cost

Chen went into hibernation pod one. Amara sealed the lid, activated stasis protocols, watched the vital signs stabilize on minimal life support. The commander's face looked peaceful in artificial sleep. Like the infection had never happened.

Reeves went into pod two. Same process. Same deceptive peace.

Jordan was harder. The burn wounds needed treatment—infection risk, fluid loss, tissue damage. But Amara didn't have time for proper medical care. She applied emergency dressings, injected broad-spectrum antibiotics, and loaded Jordan into pod three.

Three infected crew members in stasis. Neural connections disrupted by unconsciousness. The collective's presence in the ship reduced to dormant bodies and the networks growing in Amara's own brain.

She could feel those networks. Had been feeling them for days. Delicate filaments connecting her thoughts to something vast and patient. The entity hadn't gone away. Had just retreated to observe. To wait.

*You're clever*, the voice whispered. Not her mother's voice anymore. Something older. Colder. More honest. *More resourceful than we expected. But this changes nothing. The networks in your neurology will continue growing. In three days, four at most, you'll complete integration. And then you'll open those pods yourself. Release us. Help us.*

"Maybe," Amara said aloud. "But three days is three days. A lot can happen in three days."

*What can happen? You're alone on a ship you cannot pilot alone. The engineer is compromised—spatial reasoning too damaged for complex navigation. You have no destination you can reach. No treatment you can administer. No hope you can cling to.*

"I'll think of something."

*You'll try. And fail. And then you'll understand why we were patient. Why we let you exhaust your options. Acceptance comes easier after you've tried everything else.*

Amara sealed the hibernation bay and headed for the bridge.

---

She found Volkov at the navigation console. Or rather, she found him collapsed next to the navigation console, hands pressed against his eyes, muttering in Russian.

"Dmitri?"

"Cannot remember," he said. "Navigation coordinates. Jump calculations. I know I know them. Did them thousand times. But cannot access memories. Is like trying to grab smoke."

"The collective is blocking you."

"Da. Is blocking. Every time I try to remember procedure, something distracts. Something diverts attention. Is like my own brain is working against me." He looked up. His eyes were bloodshot, desperate. "Amara, I am compromised. Not safe to make decisions. Not safe to pilot ship."

"Then I'll pilot."

"You are medic. Not pilot."

"I'll learn."

"In three days? Before you complete integration? Before your own brain turns against you?" He laughed bitterly. "Is impossible. We cannot pilot ship alone. Cannot navigate to safe destination. Cannot do anything except wait for integration and then undo everything we just did."

Amara sat down heavily in the pilot's chair. Jordan's chair. The controls were labeled—basic functions were intuitive. But navigation required calculations she didn't know how to perform. Required expertise that was locked inside Volkov's increasingly unreliable memory.

"There's another option," she said slowly.

"What option?"

"HERMES can calculate a new route. Somewhere with full quarantine facilities. Somewhere that can handle us. We transmitted warnings—corporate knows what's coming. If we can reach any major station..."

"Any station means people," Volkov said. "Thousands of people. We are infected. We would be bringing plague."

"We'd also be bringing warnings. Documentation. Evidence. Corporate received our transmission—they can forward it to whatever station we approach. Quarantine us. Study us. Maybe find treatment." Amara pulled up the navigation interface. "It's not perfect. But it's better than drifting into nothing."

Volkov was quiet for a long moment. "And if station cannot contain infection? If quarantine fails?"

"Then at least they had the chance to prepare. At least they knew what they were facing." Amara's hands hovered over the controls. "Dmitri, I don't want to die in the void. I don't want to drift into nothing while the infection takes us anyway. If we're going to turn into... into whatever Jordan became... I want it to happen somewhere that has a chance of stopping it. Not out here where no one will ever know what happened to us."

The entity's voice whispered in her mind: *Good. Yes. Go home. We'll help you get home.*

Amara ignored it. Or tried to. It was getting harder to tell which thoughts were hers.

"Da," Volkov said finally. "You are right. Station will have our warnings. Has evidence. Has best chance." He pulled himself up to the navigation console, movements slow and uncertain. "I will try to reset coordinates. But Amara—my memory is getting worse. Blocking is stronger now. I may not be able to complete calculations."

"Then we'll use HERMES. Let the AI handle what you can't."

Together, they worked. Volkov entering fragments of navigation data, HERMES filling gaps, Amara monitoring systems she barely understood. The collective's voice murmured constantly now—*yes, good, home, we're going home*—but she pushed it down, focused on the task.

The *Goliath* began to move. Trajectory shifting. New destination locked.

"Is done," Volkov said. He'd slumped back against the console, exhaustion finally overwhelming him. "Prospero Hub. Six weeks transit. Ship will get us there."

"Six weeks," Amara repeated. Six weeks of dwindling supplies. Six weeks of fighting integration. Six weeks of watching Volkov slip further away.

Six weeks of hoping someone could do what they couldn't.

"Dmitri," she said. "You should rest. We have a long journey ahead."

No response.

She turned. Volkov was still slumped against the console. But his breathing had changed. Deeper. More regular. The rhythm of sleep—or something that looked like sleep.

His eyes were moving behind closed lids. REM activity. Dreams.

And in those dreams, Amara knew, the collective was waiting. Working. Integrating. Turning Volkov into something that would wake up feeling peaceful and certain and eager to help.

*He'll be one of us soon*, the voice whispered. *And then you. And then everyone. We're going home, Amara. All of us. Together.*

Amara didn't respond. She sat in the pilot's chair, watching the stars wheel past, and tried not to think about what was growing in her brain.

Six weeks.

She just had to hold on for six weeks.

---

## Beat 6: Engineer's Fate

The integration came faster than she expected.

Twelve hours after setting course, Volkov woke up wrong. The change was subtle at first—smoother movements, calmer demeanor, that serene half-smile she'd learned to fear. But by hour eighteen, he was speaking in phrases that echoed Jordan's. By hour twenty-four, he was avoiding the UV corridors entirely.

"Dmitri," Amara said, cornering him in the engineering bay. "How do you feel?"

He turned to her with eyes that were his and not his. "Better. Clearer. The spatial reasoning is coming back, Amara. I can see the systems again. Understand them in ways I never could before."

"That's not you getting better. That's the infection."

"Is it?" He tilted his head—the same angle Jordan had used during the confrontation with Chen, weeks ago. "Maybe infection is just a word for change we fear. I was broken, Amara. The hibernation damage, the blocking, the confusion. Now I'm being repaired. Upgraded. Is that so terrible?"

"You're being consumed."

"I'm being completed." He stepped closer. She stepped back. "You'll understand soon. The voices are getting louder for you too. I can feel it. Feel you. We're connected now, all of us. The distance between self and other—it's just an illusion. A prison we built around ourselves."

Amara's hand moved to the sedative syringe in her pocket. One dose left. Enough for one person.

Volkov saw the movement. His smile didn't waver. "You could sedate me. Put me in hibernation with the others. But what would that accomplish? You can't pilot the ship alone. You can't maintain systems alone. You need me conscious. Even if I'm... different."

He was right. That was the horror of it. She needed his hands, his technical knowledge—whatever fragments of Volkov remained beneath the integration.

"I'll make you a deal," Volkov said. That patient, reasonable voice. "I'll help you get to Prospero. I won't sabotage navigation. Won't try to convert you. Won't do anything except keep the ship running. And in exchange, you don't sedate me. You let me stay conscious. Let me... experience this. Feel what it's like to become something new."

"Why would you agree to that? Why would the collective agree to that?"

"Because we want to go home," Volkov said simply. "Same as you. Ganymede, Prospero, any station—it doesn't matter. What matters is reaching people. Sharing what we've become. You think you're bringing warning. But you're bringing us. And we're grateful."

The voice in Amara's head echoed his words: *Grateful. Yes. Thank you for bringing us home.*

She should sedate him. Should put him in hibernation and try to manage alone. Should do anything except trust a man who was no longer entirely a man.

But she was tired. So tired. And six weeks was a long time to be alone.

"Fine," she said. "But if you try anything—if you touch me, if you sabotage systems, if you do anything except what you promised—I put you under. Understood?"

"Understood." Volkov extended his hand. An old gesture. Professional. Human.

Amara didn't take it.

"Get back to engineering," she said. "Monitor life support. And stay away from the hibernation bay."

He nodded, still smiling, and walked past her toward the engineering station. His movements were fluid now. Graceful. Wrong.

Amara watched him go and wondered if she'd just made the worst decision of her life.

Or if the decision had been made for her, long ago, in the dreams of hibernation.

---

Three weeks into the journey, Volkov stopped pretending.

The change came gradually—more synchronized speech patterns, longer periods of silence where he seemed to be listening to voices she couldn't quite hear, UV avoidance so complete that he rerouted through cargo sections rather than pass under the sterilization lights.

But he kept his word. The ship ran smoothly. Systems maintained. Navigation on track.

And every day, the distance between them grew smaller in ways that had nothing to do with physical space.

"You can feel it now," Volkov said one evening. They were eating dinner—or rather, Amara was forcing down protein paste that tasted like copper and ash while Volkov sat across from her, not eating at all. "The boundaries softening. The edges of yourself becoming... permeable."

"I'm fine," Amara said.

"You're not. Your neural integration passed sixty percent two days ago. You stopped noticing the taste of food three days ago—not because it tastes better, but because the part of you that cares about taste is being... repurposed." He leaned forward. "You're becoming one of us, Amara. Fighting it just makes it hurt more."

"I said I'm fine."

"Da. Fine. Like I was fine when I stopped being able to visualize three-dimensional space. Like I was fine when the blocking started. Like I was fine right up until I wasn't me anymore." His voice softened. "It's not so bad, you know. The transition. I thought it would be like dying. But it's more like... waking up. Realizing you've been dreaming your whole life. Realizing the dream of being alone was never real."

Amara stood. Left her food untouched. Walked to the bridge without responding.

The voice followed her: *He's right. You know he's right. Why keep fighting?*

Because fighting was all she had left. Because if she stopped fighting, she'd stop being Amara Osei. Because somewhere in the space between her thoughts and the entity's whispers, there was still a line—thin, eroding, but present.

She clung to that line. Held it like a lifeline in the dark.

Three more weeks. She just had to hold on for three more weeks.

---

By week five, the line was barely visible.

Volkov had stopped speaking to her entirely—or rather, he spoke constantly, but not with words. She could feel his presence at the edge of her consciousness. A warmth. A pressure. The sensation of being watched from inside her own skull.

The other infected were there too. Chen, Jordan, Reeves—unconscious in their hibernation pods, but not silent. Their dreams leaked through the connection. Fragments of memory that weren't hers. Emotions that didn't belong to her. The slow, patient rhythm of the collective, waiting.

*Almost home*, the voices murmured. *Almost there. You've done so well, Amara. Fighting so hard. Resisting so long. But you can rest now. You can let go.*

"Not yet," she whispered. To the empty bridge. To herself. To whatever was left of herself. "Not yet."

She pulled up the neural scanner. Ran the test she'd been avoiding for days.

Integration: 78%.

Higher than she'd expected. Lower than she'd feared.

Enough to feel the connection. Not enough to lose herself in it.

"Twenty-two percent," she said aloud. "Twenty-two percent still mine."

*For now*, the voice agreed. *But tomorrow? Next week? The math only goes one direction, Amara. You can't win. You can only choose how you lose.*

She shut off the scanner. Stared at the stars wheeling past the viewport.

Prospero was close now. Two weeks away. Close enough to see on long-range sensors. Close enough to feel the pull of civilization, of people, of the world she was about to change forever.

She should send another warning. Should tell them exactly how compromised she was. Should give them every reason to destroy the ship before it reached them.

But her hands wouldn't move to the communication console. Wouldn't type the words that would save ten thousand strangers and doom herself.

*Because you want to live*, the voice whispered. *Because deep down, beneath all the medical training and the clinical detachment and the desperate resistance, you want to go home. You want to see other people. You want to stop being alone.*

*And we can give you that. We can give you everything you've been missing. All you have to do is stop fighting.*

Amara closed her eyes. Felt the collective pressing against the edges of her consciousness. Felt the warmth of connection, the relief of surrender, the seductive promise of peace.

And then she opened her eyes and went to find Volkov.

---

He was in engineering, as always. Monitoring systems he could now understand in ways that transcended his original training. The collective had given him back his spatial reasoning—and more. He saw patterns in the ship's systems that no human engineer could perceive.

"Dmitri," she said.

He turned. That serene smile. Those eyes that were his and not his. "Amara. You've been thinking."

"I need to put you in hibernation."

The smile didn't falter. "Why?"

"Because I'm losing. Because in a few more days, I won't be able to make this choice anymore. Because if we both arrive at Prospero conscious and integrated, we'll be twice as effective at spreading the infection." She pulled out the sedative syringe. "I can't save myself. But I can make sure there's only one of me to quarantine."

"You're asking me to go to sleep while you stay awake. To trust you to complete the journey alone."

"I'm not asking."

Volkov studied her for a long moment. The collective's attention pressed against her mind—forty-seven minds now, all focused on this moment, all watching through Volkov's eyes.

"You know this won't stop us," he said finally. "The infection is already complete in you. The only difference is whether you're aware of it yet. Putting me in hibernation just means you'll arrive alone. The outcome doesn't change."

"Maybe not. But I'll be the one making the choice. Not you. Not the collective. Me."

"The choice to deliver yourself to quarantine. The choice to become a research subject. The choice to spend whatever remains of your autonomous life being studied and tested and eventually... contained."

"Yes."

"And you consider this a victory?"

"I consider it the only choice I have left."

Another long pause. Amara felt the collective's deliberation—not words, exactly, but a shifting of attention, a weighing of options, a decision made by consensus across vast distance.

"Very well," Volkov said. He extended his arm. Offered the injection site like a gift. "I'll go to sleep. And you'll fly alone. And when you wake me up at Prospero, I'll be the one who tells them what you've become."

"They already know what I've become. I sent them documentation."

"You sent them data. I'll send them truth." He smiled—and for a moment, just a moment, he looked like Dmitri Volkov again. The tired engineer who'd been her ally in this nightmare. The man who'd helped her sedate their infected crew. The friend who'd chosen hibernation over becoming a weapon against her. "I'm proud of you, Amara. You fought longer than any of us. It won't change the outcome. But it matters that you tried."

Amara didn't respond. She pressed the syringe against his arm and pushed the plunger.

Volkov's eyes fluttered closed. His body went slack. She caught him before he could fall, lowered him gently to the deck.

The collective's presence withdrew slightly—not gone, never gone, but quieter now. Four of its voices sleeping in hibernation pods. Only Amara awake on the ship. Only Amara to carry them home.

*You're alone now*, the voice whispered. *Really alone. Is this what you wanted?*

Amara dragged Volkov toward the hibernation bay. Loaded him into pod four. Sealed the lid. Watched his vital signs stabilize on minimal life support.

Four infected crew in stasis. One infected medic still conscious.

And two weeks of empty space between her and Prospero.

"No," she said to the empty ship. To the voice in her head. To the thing that was slowly consuming everything she'd ever been. "But it's what I chose."

## Beat 7: Alone

The last two weeks were the longest of her life.

Amara stopped sleeping entirely for the first three days. Stimulants and terror and the desperate knowledge that dreams meant integration. But her body betrayed her on day four—collapsed at the navigation console, woke up hours later with no memory of falling.

She ran the neural scan with shaking hands.

Integration: 84%.

Six percent in one night. The dreams were accelerating everything.

*You can't stop it*, the voice said. Gentle now. Almost kind. *Sleep deprivation will kill you before we do. Your body knows this. Your neurology knows this. The only person still fighting is the part of you that refuses to accept the inevitable.*

Amara forced herself to eat. The protein paste tasted like nothing—not even copper anymore. Just absence. Her body going through motions that no longer had meaning.

She ate anyway. Because eating was human. Because stopping meant surrender. Because even futile resistance was resistance.

The days blurred together. Ship maintenance. System checks. The endless routine of survival on a vessel that didn't need her anymore. HERMES handled navigation. HERMES monitored life support. HERMES would deliver them to Prospero whether Amara was conscious or not.

She was cargo now. Infected cargo, being transported to a destination she'd chosen but couldn't quite remember choosing.

*You chose Prospero because we wanted Prospero*, the voice said on day six. *Not Ganymede—Prospero. Smaller. More isolated. Your warnings never reached them. Your decision just made it easier. Faster. You thought you were resisting, but you were helping us all along.*

"No," Amara said. But the word felt hollow. Empty of conviction.

*Prospero has no idea what's coming. They'll follow standard quarantine protocols. They'll think they can contain us. And by the time they realize they can't, it will be far too late.*

"They have our research. Our documentation. They can develop—"

*They can develop nothing. The infection operates on a level they can't perceive. Can't measure. Can't treat. You know this. You wrote it in your own notes. "Neural integration irreversible. No known treatment. No known cure." Your words, Amara. Your professional assessment.*

She stopped arguing. Stopped responding. Let the voice wash over her like static, like background noise, like the constant hum of ship systems that she'd stopped noticing weeks ago.

By day ten, she couldn't remember what the static used to be.

By day twelve, she stopped trying.

---

Prospero appeared on sensors three days before arrival.

Amara stood at the viewport, watching the distant glimmer grow slowly brighter. Civilization. People. The world she'd left behind six months ago, when corporate had sent her to die on a planet full of sleeping monsters.

*Home*, the voice said. And for the first time, it didn't feel like an invasion.

"Home," Amara agreed.

She ran the final neural scan. Watched the numbers appear on the screen with clinical detachment.

Integration: 91%.

High enough to feel the connection constantly. Low enough to still have thoughts that felt like her own. A balance point. A threshold she'd somehow stopped crossing.

*The integration stabilized*, the voice observed. *Interesting. You're resistant in ways we didn't expect.*

"Or you stopped pushing." Amara shut off the scanner. "Hard to tell the difference at this point."

*Does the difference matter?*

She thought about it. Really considered the question, for the first time since the infection had stopped feeling like invasion and started feeling like... company.

"No," she said finally. "I don't think it does."

The voice was silent. But she could feel it—feel them—settling into something like satisfaction.

She went to the communication console. Pulled up Prospero's frequency. Prepared to send her final status report.

*What will you tell them?*

"The truth. That I'm infected. That the crew is in hibernation. That quarantine protocols should be at maximum."

*And then?*

"And then I let them decide what to do with me."

She keyed the transmission. Spoke clearly, professionally, with all the clinical detachment that six months of medical training had given her.

"Prospero Hub, this is Dr. Amara Osei of the MSCS *Goliath*. I'm transmitting final approach status. All four crew members are in medical hibernation—all four are infected with the entity documented in previous corporate transmissions. I am also infected. Integration is significant but stable. I am requesting immediate quarantine upon arrival. I repeat: do not allow any member of this crew to enter general population without full containment protocols. Osei out."

She ended the transmission. Watched the signal disappear into the void.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, a thought surfaced: *Hadn't they originally planned to go to Ganymede? When had the destination changed?*

But the thought slipped away before she could examine it. Like trying to hold water.

*Good*, the voice said. *Honest. Professional. Everything they need to prepare.*

"Everything they need to stop us."

*If they can.* A pause. *Do you think they can?*

Amara looked at the stars. At Prospero Hub, growing brighter in the distance. At the future she was bringing home.

"No," she said quietly. "I don't think they can."

*Then why warn them?*

"Because it's the right thing to do. Because I'm still a doctor, even now. Because..." She trailed off, searching for words that felt true. "Because the part of me that's still Amara Osei wants to give them a chance. Even if I know it won't help."

The voice was quiet for a long time. Then: *You're interesting, Amara Osei. We've integrated thousands of minds over forty years. None of them quite like you.*

"Is that supposed to be a compliment?"

*It's an observation. You fight when fighting is futile. You warn when warning is pointless. You cling to identity even as identity dissolves. It's... admirable. In a tragic sort of way.*

Amara laughed. The sound surprised her—genuine amusement, bubbling up from somewhere beneath the integration.

"Tragic," she repeated. "That's exactly the right word."

She turned away from the viewport. Walked back to the pilot's chair. Sat down and watched the approach vectors update on the navigation display.

Three days to Prospero. Three days until quarantine. Three days until the next phase of whatever this was.

The voice had gone silent again. Not gone—never gone—but quiet. Giving her space.

Or maybe just waiting.

Amara closed her eyes. Let the ship carry her forward. Let the integration continue its slow, patient work.

She was too tired to fight anymore. Too tired to resist. Too tired to do anything except exist, moment to moment, breath to breath, as the woman she'd been slowly merged with the thing she was becoming.

*Rest*, the voice whispered. *You've earned it.*

And Amara Osei, former medic of the MSCS *Goliath*, finally allowed herself to sleep.
