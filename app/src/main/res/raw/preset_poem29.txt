What Water Knows (3s)

The creek behind your house (2s)
has been trying to tell you something (2s)
for seventeen years. (4s)

You've watched it shrink each summer (2s)
to a trickle between stones, (3s)
barely enough to wet your hand, (3s)
and thought: this is manageable, (3s)
this is small. (4s)

But in March it remembers what it is. (3s)
Gathers itself from a hundred hidden places (3s)
snow melt, underground veins, (3s)
the patience of accumulated rain (4s)
and rises. (5s)

Last spring it took the footbridge. (3s)
The wood you thought was permanent (3s)
turned out to be temporary (3s)
when enough water (3s)
decided to move. (5s)

You stood on the bank watching (2s)
the brown surge carry off (3s)
two-by-fours, railings, (3s)
the small architecture of your certainty (4s)
that gentle things stay gentle. (5s)

Now when you cross on the new bridge (2s)
you look down differently (3s)
at the clear water, barely ankle-deep, (3s)
and remember (3s)
what it can become. (6s)
