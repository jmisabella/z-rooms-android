Water (3s)

It falls from sky as gentle rain, (1s)
pools in hollows, filling wells, (1s)
the substance that sustains our veins, (1s)
liquid where life first dwells. (3s)

It starts as mist, as morning dew, (1s)
collects in drops on leaf and grass, (1s)
so soft it barely touches you, (1s)
so light you'd hardly know it passed. (3s)

But gather enough of it together, (1s)
let it accumulate and flow, (1s)
and suddenly this gentle weather (1s)
becomes a force you cannot know (3s)

Rivers carving canyons deep, (1s)
floods that swallow towns and roads, (1s)
oceans holding secrets in their keep, (1s)
waves that bear impossible loads. (3s)

Takes the shape of what contains it, (1s)
fits itself to every space, (1s)
patient, adaptable, nothing restrains it (1s)
from finding its own place. (3s)

It can be ice, steam, liquid form, (1s)
shifting states with heat and cold, (1s)
gentle ripple, raging storm, (1s)
the youngest substance and the old. (3s)

It cleanses wounds and washes dirt, (1s)
baptizes, blesses, makes things new, (1s)
but it can drown, destroy, and hurt, (1s)
the same substance, different view. (3s)

We are made of water mostly, (1s)
carried in cells and bones, (1s)
you are ocean, river, coastal sea, (1s)
ancient currents, fluid zones. (3s)

Taken for granted until it's gone, (1s)
this clear, essential, common thing, (1s)
keeps us living, moving on, (1s)
falls from clouds, emerges from the spring. (3s)

So humble in a glass beside the bed, (1s)
so mighty when it claims the shore, (1s)
the paradox on which we're fed (1s)
too much will kill, too little more. (3s)

Respect the water, what it gives, (1s)
its power to create and destroy, (1s)
remember that because of it you live, (1s)
and what it offers, it can take away. (3s)
