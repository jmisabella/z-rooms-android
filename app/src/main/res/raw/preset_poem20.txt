The Changed (3s)

Marcus doesn't blink enough anymore. (2s)
Three times a minute, maybe four, (1s)
when it used to be fifteen. (1.5s)
Someone counted. (2s)
No one says why they were counting. (3.5s)

He still tells the same jokes, (1.5s)
laughs at the same moments, (1s)
knows everyone's rotation schedule, (1.5s)
their coffee preferences, (1s)
the names of their children back home. (2.5s)
But his hands rest differently now— (2s)
palms up, fingers slightly curled, (1.5s)
like he's forgotten what hands are for. (4s)

Chen noticed it first. (2s)
Mentioned it to Sara during third shift, (1.5s)
both of them watching Marcus (1s)
through the galley window, (1.5s)
the way he held his fork (1s)
point-down into his meal, (1.5s)
methodically, (1s)
as if eating were a task he'd read about (2s)
but never quite practiced. (3.5s)

Then Sara stopped saying "you know?" (2.5s)
That phrase she punctuated everything with, (1.5s)
her verbal tic for six years of missions— (2s)
just gone. (2s)
She didn't notice. (2.5s)
Chen did. (4s)

Now Chen watches both of them. (2s)
And they watch her back. (2.5s)
All three smiling, (1.5s)
still using each other's names, (1.5s)
still finishing their tasks, (1.5s)
but there's a quality to the quiet now, (2s)
like something listening. (4.5s)

The ship hums the same frequency. (2s)
The air tastes recycled, metallic, normal. (1.5s)
Everything functions. (2s)
Everyone reports green. (2.5s)

But Chen can't remember (2s)
the last time Marcus mentioned his daughter. (2s)
Sara used to talk about planting a garden (1.5s)
when she got back— (1s)
tomatoes, basil, something living. (2s)
Now she talks about the mission parameters, (1.5s)
the data streams, (1s)
the beautiful efficiency of the navigation algorithms. (3s)
Her eyes bright when she says "beautiful." (4s)

Chen locks her cabin at night now. (2.5s)
Knows it won't help. (2s)
Knows the thing that changes people (1.5s)
doesn't need doors. (3s)
Knows she might already be changed (2s)
and not know it, (1.5s)
might have stopped doing something (1.5s)
she always did, (1s)
dropped some small human habit (1.5s)
that Marcus and Sara are now counting. (5s)

She catches her reflection in the dark viewport. (2.5s)
Tries to remember (1.5s)
how many times she used to blink. (4.5s)
