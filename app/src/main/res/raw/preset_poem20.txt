The Changed (3s)

They traveled far beyond the edge of known, (1s)
a crew of souls who trusted one another, (1s)
bound by purpose, never quite alone, (1s)
each one a sister, each one a brother. (3s)

But something waited in the dark between, (1s)
something patient, something old and wise, (1s)
it slipped inside where it could not be seen, (1s)
and wore their faces, spoke through borrowed eyes. (3s)

The first to change showed nothing on the surface, (1s)
smiled the same smile, laughed the same way, (1s)
but something fundamental lost its purpose, (1s)
something vital slipped away. (3s)

And then another fell beneath the veil, (1s)
transformed while sleeping, dreaming unknown dreams, (1s)
woke up wearing their own skin like mail, (1s)
a perfect copy—or so it seems. (3s)

How do you know when someone isn't real? (1s)
When the words are right but something's wrong? (1s)
When you can't name exactly what you feel (1s)
except they've been a stranger all along? (3s)

They look at one another now with doubt, (1s)
searching faces that they used to know, (1s)
wondering who's been hollowed out, (1s)
who's still themselves, who's just for show. (3s)

The worst part isn't losing who they were, (1s)
it's that the changed ones never know they've changed, (1s)
they carry on, their memories a blur, (1s)
convinced that nothing has been rearranged. (3s)

Perhaps we're all being slowly replaced, (1s)
by versions that think they're still the same, (1s)
perhaps the self is just a borrowed space (1s)
we occupy until we lose our name. (3s)

Who remains when transformation's through? (1s)
What part persists when all the rest is gone? (1s)
They wonder this as they look at who (1s)
they thought they were before the change came on. (3s)

In the silence of that distant ship, (1s)
they watch each other, wonder, wait, (1s)
knowing any one of them could slip (1s)
and never realize their altered state. (3s)
