Almost (3s)

Every morning the light falls (2s)
exactly where I wanted to be standing. (3s)

I'm always one step over, (2s)
in shadow, (1s)
watching the warmth (1s)
touch the floor where I was (2s)
or where I'm about to go. (4s)

There's a version of this life (2s)
running parallel, (1s)
so close I can hear it (2s)
like music through a wall, (2s)
rhythm I almost recognize, (2s)
words I can't quite make out. (4s)

Sometimes I catch myself reaching (2s)
for something that isn't there, (2s)
hand already shaped (1s)
for the weight of it, (2s)
fingers remembering (1s)
what they've never held. (4s)

The ache isn't in the wanting. (3s)

It's in the nearness, (2s)
the way I can see it, (2s)
taste the edge of it, (2s)
feel the temperature change (1s)
when I get close. (4s)

If it were impossible (2s)
I could let it go. (3s)

But it's right there, (2s)
always right there, (2s)
breathing distance, (1s)
and I am always (2s)
one breath short. (5s)
