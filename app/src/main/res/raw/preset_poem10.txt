The Covenant of Damage (3s)

Something small arrived carrying its own weather. (1s)
You opened the door. The weather stayed. (3s)

Love is not the same as solving. (1s)
Love is the agreement to witness (1s)
what cannot be fixed, (1s)
to choose the ruined cabinet (1s)
over the easier room. (3s)

He writes in a language (1s)
older than domestication (1s)
feral syntax, the grammar of before-trust, (1s)
inscribing his fear on every surface (1s)
you tried to make clean. (2s)

And you, (1s)
reading these hieroglyphs in waking hours, (1s)
understanding perfectly (1s)
that responsibility is just another word (1s)
for becoming the radius (1s)
of someone else's trauma, (1s)
for standing in the splash zone (1s)
of someone else's trauma, (1s)
saying: I know. I'm still here. (3s)

The world offers you permission to leave. (1s)
The world is always offering permission. (2s)

But obligation has roots that grow backward (1s)
not from what he owes you (1s)
but from what you became (1s)
the moment you said yes (1s)
to a creature who had already learned (1s)
that yes means nothing, (1s)
that doors close, that safety (1s)
is a trick of light. (3s)

Some bonds are not about joy. (1s)
Some bonds are the decision (1s)
to be haunted willingly, (1s)
to let another's brokenness (1s)
rearrange your life (1s)
because once, without thinking, (1s)
you made a promise (1s)
to something that had stopped (1s)
believing in promises. (3s)

The house smells like betrayal. (1s)
Your hands smell like enzyme cleaner. (3s)

This is love: (1s)
not the fantasy of mutual completion (1s)
but the arithmetic of staying (1s)
calculating daily whether you can bear (1s)
one more refutation of everything (1s)
you tried to offer, (1s)
one more proof that kindness (1s)
doesn't cure, doesn't even translate, (2s)

and choosing, still, to be the one (1s)
who doesn't disappear. (3s)
