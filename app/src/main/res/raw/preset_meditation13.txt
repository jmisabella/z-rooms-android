Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this (4s)

Kindness is a practice. (1.5s)
It starts with yourself, (1s)
Then ripples outward… (1.5s)
In widening circles… (1.5s)
Until it touches everyone. (6s)

Close your eyes… (1.5s) and arrive here. (5s)

Today we'll practice loving-kindness meditation. (3s)
Starting with yourself… (1.5s)
Then expanding outward… (1.5s)
In widening circles. (6s)

Begin by picturing yourself… (2s)
Just as you are right now. (4s)

And silently offer these words… (2s)
"May I be safe." (4s)
"May I be peaceful." (4s)
"May I be healthy." (4s)
"May I live with ease." (6s)

Let those words settle in. (3s)
Really receive them. (8s)

Now bring to mind someone you love. (2s)
Picture their face. (3s)

Offer them the same… (2s)
"May you be safe." (4s)
"May you be peaceful." (4s)
"May you be healthy." (4s)
"May you live with ease." (6s)

Now expand the circle further. (2s)
Think of someone neutral… (1.5s)
Maybe someone you saw today but don't really know. (3s)

Offer them these words too… (2s)
"May you be safe." (4s)
"May you be peaceful." (4s)
"May you be healthy." (4s)
"May you live with ease." (6s)

And now, (0.5s) if you're able, (1s)
Bring to mind someone difficult. (2s)
You don't have to force it… (1.5s)
But if you can… (1s)
Offer them the same kindness. (3s)

"May you be safe." (4s)
"May you be peaceful." (4s)
"May you be healthy." (4s)
"May you live with ease." (8s)

Finally, (0.5s) expand the circle to include everyone. (2s)
All beings… (1.5s)
Everywhere. (3s)

"May all beings be safe." (4s)
"May all beings be peaceful." (4s)
"May all beings be healthy." (4s)
"May all beings live with ease." (10s)

Rest in that wide, (0.5s) open feeling. (12s)

When you're ready… (2.5s)
Bring your awareness back to yourself… (2s)
Back to your breath… (2s)
And gently open your eyes. (4s)
