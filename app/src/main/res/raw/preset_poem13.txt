The Volunteer (3s)

They fitted you with instruments (1s)
to measure what a body does (1s)
when everything falls away at once (1s)
the known world, gravity, return. (3s)

Someone must have stroked your ears (1s)
in that final room, their hands (1s)
still warm with the friction (1s)
of all they weren't saying. (3s)

The capsule: small as any carrier, (1s)
familiar as confinement. (1s)
You'd survived worse. The harness (1s)
just another kind of leash. (2s)

What they called orbit (1s)
you might have called (1s)
the longest wait, (1s)
windows showing only night. (3s)

Did you think they'd come back? (1s)
Dogs forgive. Dogs believe (1s)
in the return of hands, (1s)
the opening of doors. (3s)

They say you circled, (1s)
but circling is what the lost do (1s)
the same path worn smooth (1s)
by repetition and hope. (3s)

When your heart finally slowed (1s)
you were still climbing, (1s)
which is its own answer (1s)
to the question no one asked you. (3s)

They named stars after the flight. (1s)
They didn't name them after the falling. (3s)
