Lag (3s)

My body arrives first. (2s)

The rest of me catches up (2s)
seconds later, (1s)
sometimes minutes, (2s)
sliding into place behind my eyes (2s)
like someone returning to a room (1s)
they never meant to leave. (4s)

I watch my hands move things. (2s)

They're efficient, (1s)
they know where everything goes, (2s)
but there's a delay (1s)
between deciding (1s)
and seeing it happen, (2s)
like watching myself (1s)
through a screen. (4s)

People tell me things (2s)
and I hear the words (1s)
but they don't land. (2s)
They hover, (1s)
waiting for me (1s)
to arrive and receive them, (2s)
and by then the person (1s)
has moved on, (2s)
expecting an answer (1s)
I'm still trying to understand the question for. (4s)

Some days I'm so far behind (2s)
I forget to blink. (3s)

Someone points it out, (1s)
laughing, (1s)
and I feel my face smile (2s)
from a distance. (3s)

The world keeps its pace. (2s)

I keep mine. (2s)

The gap between them (2s)
is where I live now. (5s)
