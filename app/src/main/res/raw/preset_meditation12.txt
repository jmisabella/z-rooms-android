To guide our journey today. (1s)

Your body has been with you through everything. (1.2s)
Every joy… (0.8s) every struggle… (0.8s) every moment. (1.5s)
Maybe it's time to thank it. (5s)

Settle into a place where you feel safe… (0.5s) Whether sitting or lying down… (0.8s) And gently let your eyes close. (4.5s)

Let's begin with the breath. (2s)
Breathe in slowly through your nose… (4s)
And out through your mouth. (4.5s)
Again… (0.5s) in… (4s)
And out… (5s)
One more… (0.5s) breathing in… (4s)
Breathing out. (5s)

This is a practice of gratitude for the body. (2.5s)
Not how it looks, (0.5s) but what it does for you… (1.2s)
Every single day. (5s)

Let's start with your heart. (1.5s)
Place a hand over your chest if you'd like. (2.5s)
Feel it beating. (1.5s)
It's been beating since before you were born… (1.2s)
Without you ever asking. (4s)

Silently say, (0.4s) "Thank you, (0.3s) heart." (5s)

Now bring awareness to your lungs. (1.5s)
Feel them expanding… (1.5s) contracting… (2s)
Breathing for you… (1.2s)
Even when you're not paying attention. (3.5s)

"Thank you, (0.3s) lungs." (5s)

Your hands. (1.5s)
Think of all they've done today. (1.5s)
Held things… (0.8s) created things… (0.8s) touched the world. (3.5s)

"Thank you, (0.3s) hands." (5s)

Your legs and feet. (1.5s)
They carry you everywhere you need to go. (2.5s)

"Thank you, (0.3s) legs. (0.8s) Thank you, (0.3s) feet." (5s)

Your eyes. (1.5s)
They show you color… (1.2s) faces you love… (1.2s) beauty. (3.5s)

"Thank you, (0.3s) eyes." (5s)

Your mind. (1.5s)
Yes, (0.3s) even when it's anxious or worried… (1.2s)
It's trying to protect you. (2.5s)

"Thank you, (0.3s) mind." (7s)

Take a moment now to thank your whole body… (1.5s)
For simply being here. (1.2s)
Alive. (1.2s)
Doing its best. (8s)

Breathe into that gratitude. (12s)

This body is your home. (2.5s)
The only one you'll ever have. (7s)

In your own time… (2s)
Wiggle gently… (1.5s)
Stretch your body… (1.5s)
Eyes opening to the world if continuing. (2s)
To rest, (1s) stay here with eyes closed, (1s) still grateful as you drift softly into sleep. (5s)
