The Offering (3s)

The altar holds what you have brought— (2s)
small things, barely there. (2s)
A gesture made without much thought, (2s)
laid down with quiet care. (4s)

Not prayer, exactly. Just the act (2s)
of placing something down, (3s)
a small and silent pact (2s)
with what can't be found. (4s)

You don't expect an answer (2s)
or a voice to break the air. (3s)
The ritual needs nothing grander (2s)
than the simple fact you're there. (4s)

Day after day you come (2s)
to leave what weighs you most— (3s)
the parts that make you numb, (2s)
the fears you hold too close. (4s)

And maybe nothing takes them. (3s)
Maybe they remain. (3s)

But something shifts in bringing (2s)
what you cannot name. (4s)

The altar asks for nothing (2s)
but your presence and your pain. (4s)

Perhaps the offering (2s)
is not to be received— (3s)
perhaps it's the bringing (2s)
that grants you some relief. (5s)
