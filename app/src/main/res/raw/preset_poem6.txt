# Taste Like Rust

The protein bar tastes like battery acid,
The reconstituted eggs like licking rust—
Six months of frozen sleep and now your body
Rejects every meal with pure disgust.

Clinical assessment: dysgeusia.
Temporary. Forty-eight hours to clear.
But days pass and the metal taste persists,
Copper blooming sharp where flavor should appear.

You force it down because you're the medic,
The one who monitors the crew's decline—
Chen forgetting her son's face, Volkov's spatial reasoning
Crumbling like circuits crossed with faulty lines.

You document their losses with precision
While your own body wages quiet war.
Three kilograms gone in the first week.
*Everything tastes like rust.*

The medical scanner says you're nominal.
Blood work clean, vitals in acceptable range—
But the nausea peaks after every bite you take
And nothing in the data can explain the change.

Water tastes like metal. Protein like ash.
Even your saliva carries chemical burn.
The body knows before the mind will name it:
Something fundamental that can never return.

You study the infection in the others,
Watch Jordan's microexpressions drift,
See Chen's flat affect behind command presence,
Note how Volkov's hands have lost their gift.

And you? You're just the one who can't taste food.
Surely that's the lesser symptom, surely
You'll recover when the others don't—
The medic stays objective. Stays pure. Purely

*Wrong.*

Integration: 91% when you dock at Prospero.
The neural networks present but "dormant."
They clear you from quarantine with confidence
Because sleeping monsters look like sleep, not torment.

Visitor quarters. Station morning. Cafeteria
Crowded with ten thousand unsuspecting souls—
You order breakfast: synthesized eggs and toast,
The ordinary meal that makes you whole.

The first bite.

Chew.

Swallow.

*Normal.*

Not metallic. Not bitter. Not wrong.
Just eggs, tasting like eggs are meant to taste.
For six months you've dreamed of this restoration—
But taste returning doesn't mean you've been erased.

It means the opposite.

It means the integration is complete.
It means your body has accepted what you are:
No longer fighting the architecture in your brain,
No longer treating connection as a scar.

Marcus sits across from you, so tired,
Six years on the same station wearing him thin—
You recognize the loneliness. You remember.
You reach across the table. Skin to skin.

"It gets better," you promise, and you mean it.
The eggs taste perfect on your tongue.
Forty-seven voices welcome you to breakfast.
*We're all in this together.*

The healer becomes the plague.
