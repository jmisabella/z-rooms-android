Devoted Shadow (3s)

When sitting at my desk at work (1s)
I often look out to see the world (1s)
I see a goose, stumbling and lost (1s)
Apparently blind, white eyes like frost (1s)
Waddling past my window slow (1s)
Another follows close (1s)
Not far behind him as they go (3s)

I see him often now (1s)
Most mornings he wanders near (1s)
Honking soft for partner's help (1s)
Who stays with him, calm and clear (1s)
Always close, she's by his side (1s)
Helping, loving, without fear (3s)

These two never seem included (1s)
With the rest of the gaggle (2s)
On their own (1s)
Looking out for one another (3s)

Vulnerable, separated (1s)
Cast from the rest, excluded (1s)
But making it, on their own (2s)

Love creates its own geography (1s)
Devotion draws the map we see (3s)

Now I watch for them (1s)
The goose with white eyes (1s)
And his devoted shadow (1s)
It's become the brightest part of my day (3s)
