Geese (3s)

When sitting at my desk at work (1s)
I often look out the window to see the world (1s)

I see a goose  (1s)
Apparently blinded (1s)
With white eyes (1s)
Waddling past my window (1s)
Another follows (1s)
Not far behind (2s)

I see him often now (1s)
Most mornings he wanders by (1s)
Honking for help (1s)
Partner never far behind (1s)
Always close, by his side (1s)
Helping, loving (2s)

These two never seem included (1s)
With the rest of the gaggle (1s)
On their own (1s)
Looking out for one another (2s)

Vulnerable, separated (1s)
Excluded from the rest (1s)
But making it (1s)
On their own (1s)
Love creates its own geography (1s)
And devotion defines the borders (3s)

Now I watch for them (1s)
The goose with white eyes (1s)
And his devoted shadow (1s)
It's become the brightest part of my day (2s)
