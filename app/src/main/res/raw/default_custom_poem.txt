What the Wind Brought (3s)

The wind that came through your kitchen window (2s)
this morning at seven (2s)
had been somewhere else at six. (4s)

You felt it lift the curtain (2s)
carry the smell of rain that hadn't fallen yet, (3s)
something green, (2s)
something far. (4s)

It touched the back of your neck (2s)
the way a stranger's hand might (3s)
in a crowded train (3s)
brief, unbidden, gone. (5s)

You don't know (2s)
that it crossed three states to reach you, (3s)
that it scattered ash from a wildfire (3s)
into a river two hundred miles west, (4s)
that it pushed against a barn door in Nebraska (3s)
until the latch gave way. (5s)

You don't know (2s)
that it carried the sound of a child laughing (3s)
and lost it somewhere over the highway, (3s)
that it bent the wheat (3s)
and kept going. (4s)

All you know (2s)
is it moved through your kitchen (2s)
and left. (4s)

Already it's somewhere else (2s)
lifting someone else's hair, (3s)
rattling a different set of leaves, (3s)
carrying what it picked up from you (3s)
to a place you'll never see. (6s)
