The Peace of Wild Things (0.3s)
by Wendell Berry (2s)

When despair for the world grows in me (0.6s)
and I wake in the night at the least sound (0.6s)
in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be, (1.5s)
I go and lie down where the wood drake (0.6s)
rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. (2s)

I come into the peace of wild things (0.6s)
who do not tax their lives with forethought (0.6s)
of grief. (1s)
I come into the presence of still water. (2s)

And I feel above me the day-blind stars (0.6s)
waiting with their light. (1s)
For a time (0.6s)
I rest in the grace of the world, and am free. (4s)
