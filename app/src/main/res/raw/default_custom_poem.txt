Wind's Journey (3s)

It begins where no one sees, (1s)
a stirring in some distant place, (1s)
gathering itself among the trees, (1s)
deciding on its path and pace. (3s)

It travels light, carries no weight, (1s)
just movement, breath, and empty hands, (1s)
arriving early, leaving late, (1s)
touching everything it can. (3s)

It whispers through the morning grass, (1s)
makes patterns in the field of wheat, (1s)
brushes by you as it passes, (1s)
gone before you feel complete. (3s)

It has seen a thousand miles, (1s)
has crossed the mountains and the plains, (1s)
has carried seeds and snow and trials, (1s)
the scent of ocean, dust, and rains. (3s)

It doesn't stop to rest or stay, (1s)
doesn't claim a single space, (1s)
just keeps on moving, night and day, (1s)
leaving barely any trace. (3s)

Through canyon walls and city streets, (1s)
over lakes and through the pines, (1s)
it just wanders, never sleeps, (1s)
following invisible lines. (3s)

It howls sometimes, and sometimes hums, (1s)
can rage or gently sigh, (1s)
you never know which one will come, (1s)
or when it will pass by. (3s)

There's freedom in its restless motion, (1s)
in never being tied or bound, (1s)
crossing deserts, spanning oceans, (1s)
always traveling sound. (3s)

Perhaps there's something we could learn (1s)
from how it moves without a plan, (1s)
how it gives without return, (1s)
how it touches all it can. (3s)

The wind asks nothing, owns no land, (1s)
just passes through and carries on, (1s)
a presence that you understand (1s)
mostly after it has gone. (3s)

So when you feel it on your face, (1s)
or hear it rattling the trees, (1s)
remember it's been every place, (1s)
and still it moves, and still it's free. (3s)
