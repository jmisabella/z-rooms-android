Wax Lips (3s)

I used to study the way they moved (1s)
The easy confidence, the natural grace (1s)
Tried to trace their steps exactly (1s)
Memorize the cadence of their laughter (3s)

I wanted to be them but somehow make it mine (1s)
A translation that wouldn't show the seams (3s)

So I built myself a new face (1s)
Wax lips from Halloween candy (1s)
Plastic vampire teeth (1s)
Make believe I'm beautiful (1s)
Make believe I belong here (3s)

My real lips cracked and bleeding underneath (1s)
Chapped from all the performing (1s)
Dehydrated from forgetting to care for myself (1s)
While I tended this careful construction (3s)

I kept upgrading the materials (1s)
Wooden teeth now, more organic (1s)
Still fake but trying so hard to be real (3s)

Layer after layer of costume (1s)
Until I couldn't remember (1s)
What my actual face looked like (1s)
Or if I'd ever been comfortable (1s)
In my original skin (3s)

I was so busy being (1s)
What I thought you wanted to see (1s)
That I forgot to ask (1s)
Who I wanted to be (3s)
