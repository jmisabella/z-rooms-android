The Rehearsal (3s)

You practice being seen (2s)
before the mirror's frame, (2s)
adjusting what you mean (2s)
by speaking out your name. (4s)

The self you build each day (2s)
is draft, not final thing— (3s)
you try it on this way, (2s)
then shift what you will bring. (4s)

Not lying, just refining (2s)
which version feels most true. (3s)
The constant realigning (2s)
of stranger into you. (4s)

You watch yourself rehearse (2s)
the gestures that convince, (3s)
each movement you traverse (2s)
in patterns learned long since. (4s)

And some nights you forget (2s)
which part was the disguise— (3s)
the self you first project, (2s)
or the one behind your eyes. (4s)

The rehearsal doesn't end (2s)
when the mirror's done. (4s)
