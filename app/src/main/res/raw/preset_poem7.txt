Silver Theorems (3s)

In the corner where the ceiling meets the wall, (2s)
a patient architect suspends her silver geometry (1s)
each thread a calculated risk, a hope, (1s)
spun from her own small body's alchemy. (2s)

She asks for nothing but the morning dew (1s)
to jewel her work, and the buzzing wanderer (1s)
who never sees the trap laid out in air, (1s)
invisible as hunger, thin as sky. (3s)

Watch her mend what wind has torn apart, (1s)
rebuilding ruin with a quiet skill (1s)
that knows no blueprint but her ancient code, (1s)
no teacher but necessity and will. (3s)

And in the desert, armored dancers wait (1s)
beneath the stones, their stingers curved like questions, (2s)
holding venom close as any answer held (1s)
too dangerous to speak without protection. (3s)

They glow beneath the ultraviolet moon (1s)
secret fires we cannot see by day, (1s)
reminders that some beauty hides itself, (1s)
that not all light is meant for our display. (3s)

So here's to those we sweep away, who make (1s)
their homes in shadows we would rather not explore, (2s)
who teach us that survival is an art, (1s)
and patience is a kind of quiet war. (3s)
