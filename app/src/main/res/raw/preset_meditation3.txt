Before we start, (0.15s) a reflection. (1s)

The voice in your head that says you're not enough (0.8s)
Is just a thought, (0.4s) not a truth. (1s)
You can simply… (1s) let it pass by, (1s)
Like a cloud across the sky. (6s)

Get comfortable... (0.5s) Sitting or lying down, (0.6s) whatever feels right... (0.8s) And allow your eyes to gently close. (4.5s)

Let's begin with some grounding breaths. (1.5s)
Inhale slowly (0.5s) through the nose… (0.5s)
Filling the belly first, (0.5s) then the chest… (2s)
And exhale just as slowly, (0.5s) letting everything soften. (3s)

Again… (0.5s) breathe in… (3.5s) and breathe out… (4.5s)
Breathe in (4s) and breathe out (4.5s)
In (4s) and out (5s)

Good. (3s)

Now, (0.5s) place one hand on your heart (1.2s)
And one hand on your belly. (4s)

Feel the warmth of your own hands… (1.5s)
This simple gesture of kindness toward yourself. (6s)

Now, (0.5s) take a deep breath in… (0.5s)
And as you breathe out, (0.5s) whisper softly to yourself… (1s)
"I am enough." (5s)

Again… (0.6s)
Breathe in… (3.5s)
And out… (1s) "I am enough." (5s)

One more time… (0.8s)
In… (3.5s)
Out… (1s) "I am enough." (8s)

Now let your hands rest wherever feels comfortable. (4s)

If worry arises, (0.5s) or fear, (0.5s) or doubt… (1.2s)
Don't fight it. (1.5s)
Just notice where you feel it in your body. (2s)
Maybe in your chest. (1.5s) Your throat. (1.5s) Your stomach. (4s)

Breathe into that place… (1.5s)
And imagine breathing out space around it… (1.5s)
Making room for it to exist… (1s) without needing to fix it. (7s)

Anxiety wants us to solve everything… (1.2s) to plan… (0.5s) to control. (2s)
But right now, (0.5s) just for this moment, (0.6s)
You can simply be with what is. (10s)

Let's take five slow breaths together. (1.5s)
I'll count… (0.8s) you just breathe. (1.5s)

One… (5s)
Two… (5s)
Three… (5s)
Four… (5s)
Five… (8s)

Notice the quiet that follows each breath. (6s)
That little gap between breathing out and breathing in. (3s)
Rest there for a moment. (12s)

Your worth doesn't depend on productivity… (1.2s)
Or perfection… (1s)
Or being anything other than what you are right now. (10s)

You are enough. (2s)
Just as you are. (14s)

When you're ready to move again… (2s)
Wiggle your fingers gently… (1.5s)
Roll your shoulders… (1.5s)
Slowly opening your eyes if the world is calling. (2.5s)
Otherwise, (0.85s) rest here… (1s) letting sleep embrace you softly. (2s)

Carry this knowing forward. (5s)
