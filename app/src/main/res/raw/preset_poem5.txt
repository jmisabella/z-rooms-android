Visitations (3s)

We used to talk (1s)
Everyday, every evening (2s)

Now we only communicate in dreams (1s)
Not through talking (1s)
A unidirectional communication (1s)
I try to speak but sounds dissolve before they form (2s)

Your messages come to me (1s)
In times of need (1s)
Never on demand (1s)
Never when wanted (1s)
But always when needed (2s)

I was held again in loving arms (1s)
Kissed on the brow and rocked (2s)

I wish I could just join you now (1s)
But there's too much left to do here (1s)
I've got so much left to show you (3s)
