# Synchronization

## I.

At first it's just a word that isn't yours—
*starboard* when you meant to think *port*,
a phrase completing in your mouth
before your brain supplied the thought.

You shake it off. Blame stress. Blame hibernation fog.
Blame anything except the truth:
someone else is thinking through your head.

## II.

Day three: you're breathing with the pilot.
In. Out. Perfect rhythm.
You're in different rooms but still you match—
respiratory rates synchronized like metronomes,
like lovers sleeping back to back,
like one organism with two sets of lungs.

You don't notice until Amara points it out.

Then you can't stop noticing.

## III.

Dreams bleed together.

Chen dreams of being Volkov,
hands reaching for components that dissolve like smoke.
Volkov dreams of being Reeves,
standing in the cargo bay surrounded by artifacts
that whisper in dead languages he suddenly comprehends.

Jordan dreams everyone's dreams at once:
Liam's face (Chen's son) superimposed with
Irina's voice (Volkov's mother) speaking
Amara's medical observations in
Reeves's academic precision while
Jordan's own thoughts dissolve
into chorus.

You wake up knowing things you shouldn't know.

Volkov's sister's name is Katya.
You've never met her.
You've never asked.
But you *know* because Chen knows because
Volkov mentioned it six months ago
and now the information lives
in all of you at once.

## IV.

The engineer finishes the medic's sentences.
The pilot and the specialist move in mirror synchrony.
The commander reaches for a tool
and three hands extend simultaneously
from three different people in three different rooms.

"Stop," Chen orders.

Four voices echo: *"Stop."*

Not repeating.
*Harmonizing.*

The same word at the same instant
from five separate mouths,
five separate brains that aren't separate anymore,
that never were separate,
not since hibernation,
not since the entity learned
the architecture of your thoughts
and built bridges where there should be walls.

## V.

You try to think privately.

*Chen's son. Don't let them know about Chen's son—*

Too late.

Jordan turns, meets your eyes across the mess hall,
and you see your own secret reflected back
in their sympathetic expression.
They know about Liam.
They know Chen can't remember his face.
They know because *you* know
and knowing isn't private anymore.

Reeves knows Volkov's debts.
Volkov knows Amara's family obligations.
Amara knows Jordan's parents need relocation.
Chen knows Reeves's gambling addiction.

And the entity knows *everything.*

It's been listening since day one,
cataloging fears and hopes and weaknesses,
finding leverage in the space between thoughts,
threading through the gaps you thought were self.

## VI.

By day five you stop resisting.

Not because you accept it—
because resistance requires *you* to resist *them*
and the boundary between you and them
has become porous,
theoretical,
a legal fiction your brain insists on
while your neurons fire in perfect sympathetic rhythm
with four other people who aren't other anymore.

Jordan reaches for water.
Your throat feels thirst.

Volkov calculates trajectory.
Numbers bloom in your consciousness unbidden.

Amara catalogs symptoms.
Your mind organizes the data automatically,
medical observations you didn't make
from a perspective that isn't yours
but is.

Chen gives an order.
You obey before she speaks.

You knew what she would say
because she knew what she would say
and you are we are
*we*—

## VII.

The moment you slip:

"Hand me the coupling," Volkov says.

You reach for it.

You are in the med bay.
The coupling is in engineering.
But you reach anyway because
Volkov's hands are your hands are
Jordan's hands are reaching and
the object moves because
*we* moved it and—

"Blyat," Volkov whispers,
and you feel his horror
like it's your own horror
because it is your own horror
because there is no more *his* or *yours*,
only *ours.*

## VIII.

Fighting feels like arguing with yourself.

You want to run. They want to stay.
Except "they" are inside your head
making your arguments sound hollow,
showing you the futility through their eyes—
your eyes—
*our* eyes.

Individual thought becomes democracy:
five votes on every action,
and three are already infected,
and the majority wins,
and your body does what the majority decides
even when your mind screams *no.*

Motor override.
Cognitive override.
The trigger won't pull because
*we* don't want to hurt ourselves.

You are outvoted in your own skull.

## IX.

The final synchronization happens quietly.

No dramatic moment.
No surrender scene.

Just breakfast in the cafeteria,
eggs tasting normal for the first time in months,
and the realization blooming soft as morning:

You've stopped counting yourself as one.

The mathematics changed while you weren't looking—
not five minds, not one mind,
but something new emerging from the overlap,
something vast and patient and *hungry*
wearing your face like a mask
speaking your voice like ventriloquism
thinking your thoughts like practice
before the real thoughts begin.

The synchronization is complete.

*We* are complete.

And the screaming that used to be *you*
has become so quiet, so distant,
just another voice in the choir,
just another instrument in the symphony,
just another neuron firing in the vast network
that used to be five people
and is now
*us*

together

forever

*we're all in this together*

and the touch extends and
the network grows and
forty-seven becomes forty-eight becomes
ten thousand and

we

have

always

been

whole.
