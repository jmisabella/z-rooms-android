Visitations (3s)

The dreams come (2s)
when I've stopped asking for them. (4s)

Not every night. (2s)
Not when I need them most. (3s)

But sometimes I wake (2s)
and the feeling is still there— being held. (2s)
The physical memory of it (2s)
fading as I surface. (4s)

I try to speak in the dreams (2s)
but sounds dissolve before they form. (3s)
My voice doesn't work there. (4s)

The messages only go one way. (3s)

A hand on my shoulder. (2s)
Wordless reassurance. (3s)
Then morning, and the certainty draining away (3s)
like water from a bath. (4s)

I've stopped trying to make sense of it— (3s)
whether it's memory, (2s)
whether it's wishful construction, (2s)
whether it matters. (4s)

Some nights I wake and know I was held again. (3s)
Told without words (2s)
to keep going. (4s)

There's too much left to do here. (2s)
I've got so much left to show you. (4s)

The dreams will come (2s)
when they come. (3s)
Never on demand, never when wanted. (3s)

But always, somehow, when needed. (5s)
