Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this (4s)

Between every sound (0.8s) is silence. (1.5s)
Between every thought (0.8s) is stillness. (1.5s)
That silence and stillness… (1s) is always there, (0.8s)
Waiting to be noticed. (6s)

Let your eyes close gently. (4s)

Today we practice the art of listening… (1.5s)
Not with effort, (0.5s) but with allowing. (5s)

First, (0.3s) listen to the sounds around you. (2s)
Don't label them… (0.8s)
Don't judge them as good or bad… (1.2s)
Just hear them… (1s) as pure sound. (10s)

Notice sounds far away… (4s)
And sounds close by… (4s)
Just listening… (1s) without trying. (8s)

Now, (0.3s) listen to the sound of your own breath. (3s)
The subtle whisper of air… (1.5s)
The rhythm of inhale and exhale. (10s)

Can you hear your heartbeat? (3s)
Perhaps feel it more than hear it? (6s)

Just listening inward now… (1.5s)
To the quiet hum of being alive. (12s)

Thoughts will come… (1.2s)
And that's okay. (1.5s)
But instead of following them, (0.6s)
Can you hear the silence between thoughts? (3s)
That gap where nothing is happening? (8s)

Rest in that silence. (15s)

This silence is always here… (1.5s)
Underneath everything… (1.2s)
Like the ocean beneath the waves. (10s)

You can return to this quiet place anytime. (2s)
It's always available. (8s)

Let's breathe together softly. (1.5s)
In… (4.5s) and out… (5s)
In… (4.5s) and out… (5s)
In… (4.5s) and out… (8s)

Resting in the quiet. (16s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Slowly bring movement back… (1.5s)
Stretch if you like… (2s)
And gently open your eyes. (4s)

Carry some of that quiet with you. (5s)
