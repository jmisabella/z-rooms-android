The Traveler's Dilemma (3s)

A traveler moved between the folds of space, (1s)
through passages where time becomes unclear, (1s)
and somewhere in that vast and shifting place, (1s)
something split—a second self appeared. (3s)

Two travelers now, where once there had been one, (1s)
each certain they're the one who first set out, (1s)
each holding memories of what they'd done, (1s)
identical in every single thought. (3s)

They stand and face each other, mirror-true, (1s)
same scars, same voice, same history, same name, (1s)
and neither one can say which one is new, (1s)
or if the word "original" means anything at all. (3s)

How do you prove you were the first to wake? (1s)
How do you claim a past that both remember? (1s)
Every choice, every turn, every mistake (1s)
they share them all, from January to December. (3s)

Perhaps one is the echo, one the source, (1s)
or perhaps the split made equals from the start, (1s)
two paths that broke from one original course, (1s)
two futures born when one life fell apart. (3s)

The cruel part is they cannot both go on, (1s)
the universe rejects this doubling act, (1s)
one must remain, and one must be withdrawn, (1s)
but there's no way to know which life is fact. (3s)

They look at all the roads they didn't take, (1s)
the parallel lives they'll never get to see, (1s)
and realize that every choice we make (1s)
kills a thousand other versions we could be. (3s)

Which one deserves to carry on the name? (1s)
Which one has more right to the days ahead? (1s)
They're asking questions that have no answer, (1s)
standing at the crossroads of being and instead. (3s)

Maybe we're all just copies of ourselves, (1s)
repeating patterns, walking borrowed ground, (1s)
living lives pulled down from cosmic shelves, (1s)
uncertain if we're original or found. (3s)

The travelers stand in silence, face to face, (1s)
two versions of one person, both and neither, (1s)
lost in the mystery of time and space, (1s)
together and impossibly alone. (3s)
