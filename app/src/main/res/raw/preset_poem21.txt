The Traveler's Dilemma (3s)

A traveler moved between the folds of space, (1s)
through passages where time becomes unclear, (1s)
and somewhere in that vast and shifting place, (1s)
something split—a second self appeared. (3s)

Two travelers now, where once there had been one, (1s)
each certain they're the one who first set out, (1s)
each holding memories of what they'd done, (1s)
identical in every single thought. (3s)

They stand and face each other, mirror-true, (1s)
same scars, same voice, same history, same name, (2s)
and neither one can say which one is new. (4s)

Perhaps one is the echo, one the source, (1s)
or perhaps the split made equals from the start, (2s)
two paths that broke from one original course, (1s)
two futures born when one life fell apart. (3s)

The universe rejects this doubling act, (2s)
one must remain, and one must be withdrawn, (2s)
but there's no way to know which life is fact. (4s)

They look at all the roads they didn't take, (1s)
the parallel lives they'll never get to see, (2s)
at shadows cast by every choice we make. (3s)

The travelers stand in silence, face to face, (1s)
two versions of one person, both and neither, (2s)
lost in the mystery of time and space, (2s)
together and impossibly alone. (3s)
