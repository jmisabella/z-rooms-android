Split (3s)

There are two of you now. (3s)

You watch yourself (2s)
brush hair from your face (2s)
with the exact timing (1s)
you know from inside. (4s)

Both of you reach (2s)
to adjust the same collar. (3s)
Stop. (2s)
Wait for the other to go first. (4s)

Neither moves. (4s)

This is what it means (2s)
to see yourself (2s)
from the outside. (4s)

Your face (2s)
making expressions (2s)
you only know (1s)
as interior sensations. (4s)

The way you shift your weight. (2s)
The specific gesture (2s)
when you're thinking. (4s)

All of it (2s)
happening in front of you. (4s)

You both know (2s)
you're about to speak. (3s)
You both know (2s)
what you're about to say. (4s)

So neither says it. (4s)

The standoff. (3s)

Trying to act (2s)
independently (2s)
when you're identical. (4s)

Trying to decide (2s)
who goes first (2s)
when you'll both (1s)
decide the same thing (2s)
at the same time. (5s)

You're both standing there. (3s)
Both waiting. (3s)
Both knowing (2s)
the other is waiting too. (4s)

Neither knowing (2s)
who decides. (4s)

Neither knowing (2s)
if there's a difference (2s)
between deciding (2s)
and watching yourself (2s)
decide. (5s)
