The Ancient Patterns (2s)

What sleeps in stone still dreams. (1.5s)
Deep codes written in silence, (1s)
shapes that once moved through different light, (1.5s)
their forms perfect for vanished circumstance. (2.5s)

Armor and speed, tooth and wing, (1s)
each answer to a question no longer asked. (1.5s)
They held their world longer than we've held ours, (1.5s)
then settled into layers, quiet, masked. (3s)

But nothing is ever truly gone (1s)
if someone remembers how to read. (1.5s)
The language persists in fragment, in whisper, (1.5s)
in the grammar of what came before we arrived. (2.5s)

And so the unthinkable: (2s)
carrying echoes across impossible distance, (1.5s)
guarding each instruction, each detail, (1.5s)
as if shepherding flame through a storm. (3s)

Beneath unfamiliar stars, (1.5s)
where mountains stand higher and air tastes different, (1.5s)
something stirs that knew another home— (1.5s)
ancient muscle remembering its purpose. (2.5s)

They move again. (2s)
Not ghosts, not monuments. (1.5s)
Living answers to questions we found (1.5s)
in the strata, in the deep archives of time. (3s)

Is this resurrection or translation? (1.5s)
Continuation or copy? (1.5s)
Perhaps it doesn't matter— (1.5s)
beauty demands to be spoken again, (1.5s)
even in a new tongue, (1.5s)
even if the original listeners are dust. (3s)
