The Ancient Patterns (3s)

They found the blueprints buried deep in stone, (1s)
the intricate designs of what once walked, (1s)
encoded messages from a world they'd known, (1s)
preserved in silence while the ages talked. (3s)

These weren't just creatures—they were perfection's proof, (1s)
each form adapted to its chosen place, (1s)
some armored strong, some swift and light of hoof, (1s)
some towering high, some built for speed and grace. (3s)

They ruled for longer than our minds can hold, (1s)
thrived in their world with elegant command, (1s)
and when they vanished, all their stories told (1s)
were written in the layers of the land. (3s)

But someone found those patterns, read them true, (1s)
and carried them across the endless dark, (1s)
through distances where nothing living flew, (1s)
protecting every detail, every mark. (3s)

And on a world beneath a different sun, (1s)
where sky stretched vast (1s)
and mountains touched the clouds, (1s)
the ancient forms were carefully begun, (1s)
their magnificence released from burial shrouds. (3s)

They walk again on soil they've never known, (1s)
yet something in them recognizes home (1s)
the same strength, the same grace they'd always shown, (1s)
the same right to exist, to thrive, to roam. (3s)

What was lost has been restored, remade, (1s)
not copies but continuations true, (1s)
proof that beauty never fully fades, (1s)
that life finds ways to begin anew. (3s)
