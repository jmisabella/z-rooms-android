The Archive (2s)

Code preserved in stone, (2s)
carried across impossible distance. (3s)
Information shepherded like flame through a storm. (4s)

They move again. (3s)

Not ghosts. (2s)
Not monuments. (3s)

Creatures designed for Earth's gravity (2s)
performing under point-eight-seven G, (2s)
bone structure calibrated for different weight, (2s)
gaits shifting with each generation. (4s)

The larger specimens adjust faster— (2s)
mass requiring recalibration. (3s)
Their strides lengthen. (2s)
The planet's lower pull (1s)
changes how weight transfers, (2s)
how momentum carries. (4s)

Atmospheric pressure here is different. (2s)
Oxygen partial pressure higher. (2s)
Respiratory rates have already begun to shift (2s)
in ways the genetic template didn't encode. (4s)

This is what happens (2s)
when you carry information (1s)
into new context. (3s)

The DNA is faithful. (2s)
The expression changes. (3s)

Three generations now. (2s)
Behaviors emerging that weren't in the archive— (3s)
adaptations to this planet's longer day, (2s)
to prey that evolved under different light, (2s)
to gravity that allows (1s)
what Earth's pull would not. (4s)

The planet writes its own notes (2s)
in the margins of Earth's design. (3s)
New gravity revises old code. (4s)

They are what they were, (2s)
and what they're becoming. (3s)

The patterns persist. (2s)
The patterns change. (3s)
Both are true. (4s)

Watch them move through alien air, (2s)
carrying Earth in their cells, (2s)
becoming something (1s)
this world is making (1s)
from what that world made. (5s)
