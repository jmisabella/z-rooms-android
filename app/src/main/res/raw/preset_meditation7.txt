Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this (4s)

The mind will wander. (1.2s)
That's not the problem. (1.5s)
The magic happens in the moment you notice it wandered… (1.5s)
And choose to come back. (2s)
That choice… (1s) that's the practice. (6s)

Close your eyes softly… (1.5s) and arrive here. (5s)

Let's do a practice called "noting." (2s)
It helps with anxious thinking. (5s)

Simply notice what's happening… (1.2s)
And name it quietly to yourself. (4s)

For example… (1s)
"Breathing in"… (3s)
"Breathing out"… (4s)

Try that now. (2s)
In… (4s)
Out… (5s)
In… (4s)
Out… (5s)

If a thought comes, (0.5s) just note it. (1.5s)
"Thinking"… (2s)
Then return to the breath. (6s)

If you hear a sound… (1.5s)
"Hearing"… (2s)
And come back. (4s)

If you feel an emotion… (1.5s)
"Feeling"… (2s)
And return to breathing. (6s)

Let's practice this together for a little while. (2s)
I'll be quiet… (1.5s)
You just keep noting… (1.5s)
Breathing… (1s) thinking… (1s) hearing… (1s) feeling… (1.5s)
Whatever arises. (16s)

The mind will wander… (1.2s)
Maybe a dozen times… (1s)
Maybe more. (1.5s)
Each time you notice, (0.5s) that's not a failure… (1s)
That IS the practice. (5s)

Coming back… (1s) over and over… (1.5s)
That's where the strength grows. (8s)

Let's take three intentional breaths. (1.5s)
Noting each one. (1s)
In… (4.5s) out… (5s)
In… (4.5s) out… (5s)
In… (4.5s) out… (8s)

Now just rest. (3s)
No more effort. (3s)
Just being here. (14s)

Notice how you feel. (4s)
A little clearer? (2s)
A little calmer? (6s)

This clarity is always available… (1.5s)
Any time you return to the present moment. (10s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Gently open your eyes… (2s)
And notice the room around you… (2s)
Still here. (4s)
