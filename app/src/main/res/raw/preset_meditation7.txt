Let us settle in with. (1s)

The mind will wander. (1s)
That's not the problem. (1.2s)
The magic happens in the moment you notice it wandered… (1.2s)
And choose to come back. (1.5s)
That choice… (0.8s) that's the practice. (5s)

Settle into a place where you feel safe… (0.5s) Whether sitting or lying down… (0.8s) And gently let your eyes close. (4.5s)

First, (0.5s) let's ground ourselves with a few breaths. (1.5s)
Inhale slowly (0.5s) through the nose… (0.5s)
Filling the belly first, (0.5s) then the chest… (2s)
And exhale just as slowly. (3s)

Breathe in… (3.5s) and breathe out… (4.5s)
In (4s) and out (4.5s)

Good. (3s)

Now, (0.5s) let's do a practice called "noting." (0.8s)
It helps with anxious thinking. (3s)

Simply notice what's happening… (0.5s)
And name it quietly to yourself. (2.5s)

For example. (0.8s)
"Breathing in"… (2.5s)
"Breathing out"… (3.5s)

Try that now. (1.5s)
In… (4s)
Out… (5s)
In… (4s)
Out… (5s)

If a thought comes, (0.4s)
Just note it as (0.2s) "Thinking." (1.5s)
Then return to the breath. (5s)

If you hear a sound… (1.2s)
Note it as (0.1s) "Hearing." (1.5s)
And come back. (3.5s)

If you feel an emotion… (1.2s)
Note it as (0.05s) "Feeling." (1.5s)
And return to breathing. (5s)

Let's practice this together for a little while. (1.5s)
I'll be quiet… (1.2s)
You just keep noting… (1.2s)
Breathing… (0.8s) thinking… (0.8s) hearing… (0.8s) feeling… (1.2s)
Whatever arises. (14s)

The mind will wander. (1s)
Maybe a dozen times… (0.8s)
Maybe more. (1.2s)
Each time you notice, (0.4s) that's not a failure. (0.8s)
That IS the practice. (4s)

Coming back… (0.8s) over and over… (1.2s)
That's where the strength grows. (7s)

Let's take three intentional breaths. (1.2s)
Noting each one. (0.8s)
In… (4.5s) out… (5s)
In… (4.5s) out… (5s)
In… (4.5s) out… (7s)

Now just rest. (2.5s)
No more effort. (2.5s)
Just being here. (12s)

Notice how you feel. (3.5s)
A little clearer. (1.5s)
A little calmer. (5s)

This clarity is always available… (1.2s)
Any time you return to the present moment. (8s)

When you're ready… (1.5s)
Begin to stir gently… (1.5s)
Opening your eyes if the day continues… (1.5s)
Otherwise, (1s) stay here in this calm, (1s) letting peaceful sleep find you. (4s)
