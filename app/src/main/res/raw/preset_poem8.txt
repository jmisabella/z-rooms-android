Proof (3s)

If repetition then recognition (1s)
if recognition then the breath held (1s)
between what was and what returns (2s)
the same angle twice (1s)
is already a hymn (2s)

When the fold repeats itself (1s)
when the sequence builds its tower (1s)
from nothing but addition (1s)
we call this order but maybe (1s)
it's just echo answering echo (2s)

The grid drinks whatever fills it (1s)
knowing only the thirst for edges (1s)
for space bent into confession (2s)
for the infinite parceled (1s)
into units we can name (2s)

The spiral's hunger satisfies (1s)
not through beauty (1s)
but through insistence (1s)
that even expansion must bow (1s)
that growth is memory in motion (2s)

The theorem asks nothing (1s)
offers less (1s)
whispers only: given this stone (1s)
you cannot avoid that river (2s)
and we mistake this cold current for truth (3s)

What if pattern is just (1s)
the universe's refusal (1s)
to dream twice (1s)
what if symmetry (1s)
is memory (2s)
pretending to be law (3s)
