Proof (3s)

If repetition then recognition (1s)
if recognition then the breath held (1s)
between what was and what returns (1s)
the same angle twice (1s)
is already a hymn (2s)

When the fold repeats itself (1s)
when the sequence builds its tower (1s)
from nothing but addition (1s)
we call this order but maybe (1s)
it's just echo answering echo (2s)

The grid doesn't care what it contains (1s)
only that edges align (1s)
that space submits to division (1s)
that the infinite can be parceled (1s)
into units we can count (2s)

Something about the spiral satisfies (1s)
not because it's beautiful (1s)
but because it insists (1s)
that expansion has a shape (1s)
that growth remembers where it started (2s)

The theorem asks nothing (1s)
offers less (1s)
says only: given this (1s)
you cannot avoid that (1s)
and we mistake this coldness for truth (3s)

What if pattern is just (1s)
the universe preferring (1s)
not to invent itself twice (1s)
what if all this symmetry (1s)
is only exhaustion (3s)
