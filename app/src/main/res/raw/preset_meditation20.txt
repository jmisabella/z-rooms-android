Before we begin, (0.15s) from the Buddha (4s)

The secret of health for both mind and body (1s)
Is not to mourn for the past, (0.8s)
Nor to worry about the future, (0.8s)
But to live the present moment wisely and earnestly. (6s)

Find your comfortable position… (1.5s) and close your eyes. (5s)

This final meditation is about simply being. (3s)
No technique to master… (1.5s)
No goal to achieve… (1.5s)
Just this. (6s)

Notice that you're breathing. (4s)
You don't have to change it… (1.5s)
Just notice it's happening. (6s)

Notice that you're sitting or lying here. (3s)
Feel the contact with the surface beneath you. (5s)

Notice any sounds. (4s)
They come… (2s) they go. (4s)

Notice you're alive. (3s)
Right here… (2s) right now. (6s)

That's it. (2s)
That's the practice. (5s)
Simply noticing… (2s) being aware… (2s) being present. (8s)

You don't have to be anywhere else. (3s)
You don't have to be anyone else. (3s)
This moment… (1.5s) as it is… (1.5s) is enough. (10s)

Thoughts will come. (2s)
Let them. (3s)
They're just thoughts. (6s)

Feelings will arise. (2s)
Let them. (3s)
They're just feelings. (6s)

And underneath all of it… (2s)
You remain. (3s)
The awareness… (2s)
The one who notices. (8s)

Rest as that awareness. (16s)

Nothing to do… (3s)
Nowhere to go… (3s)
No one to be. (8s)

Just being. (14s)

This is meditation. (3s)
This simplicity. (8s)

Breathe. (6s)
Be. (10s)

When you're ready to return… (3s)
Know that you can come back to this simplicity anytime. (3s)
It's always here. (4s)

Wiggle gently… (2s)
Stretch if you like… (2s)
And slowly… (1.5s) gently… (1.5s)
Open your eyes. (5s)
