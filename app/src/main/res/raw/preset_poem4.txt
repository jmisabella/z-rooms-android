The Glass (3s)

There's a thickness to the air between me and everyone else. (3s)

Not visible, (1s)
not something I can point to, (2s)
but when I reach out (1s)
my hand stops (1s)
a few inches before contact. (3s)

I watch people laugh (2s)
and I laugh too, (1s)
same rhythm, (1s)
same sound, (2s)
but it arrives from somewhere else, (2s)
a recording played on cue. (4s)

Someone says my name (2s)
and I answer, (1s)
but the person answering (1s)
isn't quite (1s)
the one they think they know. (4s)

The space gets wider when I don't pay attention. (3s)

I've started noticing (2s)
how people's eyes move past me (2s)
even when they're looking right at me, (2s)
the way you look through glass (1s)
at what's behind it. (4s)

I could tell someone. (2s)
I could say the words. (3s)

But the words would travel (1s)
through that same thick air, (2s)
arrive muffled, (1s)
ordinary, (2s)
and they would nod (1s)
and say something kind (2s)
and not understand (1s)
that I'm already (1s)
on the other side. (5s)
