The Dream Where My Teeth Fall Out (3s)

They say it's one of the most common dreams (1s)
The slow crumbling (1s)
One tooth loose, then another (1s)
Until your whole mouth is full of fragments (1s)
Pieces of yourself coming apart in your hands (3s)

I used to wake up terrified (1s)
Checking with my tongue (1s)
Making sure everything was still there (1s)
Still solid, still mine (3s)

But maybe the dream knows something (1s)
About how we're supposed to let go (1s)
How we're always falling apart (1s)
Just slowly enough not to notice (1s)
In the waking world (3s)

One day we'll all be underground (1s)
Cold and returned to elements (1s)
And it won't matter (1s)
How tightly we held on (1s)
Or how hard we fought the unraveling (3s)

Because we'll finally rejoin (1s)
Whatever we were before we learned (1s)
To grip so hard (1s)
Before we knew how to be afraid (1s)
Of becoming nothing again (3s)
