The Dream Where My Teeth Fall Out (3s)

They say it's one of the most common dreams (1s)
The slow crumbling (1s)
One tooth loose, then another (1s)
Until your whole mouth is full of fragments (1s)
Pieces of yourself coming apart in your hands (3s)

I used to wake up terrified (1s)
Checking with my tongue inside (1s)
Making sure everything was there (1s)
Still solid, still mine, they're all still here (3s)

But maybe the dream knows something (1s)
Of how we should let go (1s)
Of how we're always falling apart (1s)
Too gradual, too slow (1s)
Just slowly enough not to notice (1s)
In the waking world (3s)

One day I'll be underground (1s)
Returning to the elements (1s)
Without a word, without a sound (1s)
As it won't matter in the end (1s)
How tightly I held on (1s)
Or how hard I fought the unraveling (3s)

Because we'll finally rejoin (1s)
Whatever we were before we learned (1s)
To grip so hard (1s)
Before we knew how to be afraid (1s)
Of becoming nothing again (3s)
