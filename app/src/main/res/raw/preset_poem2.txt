The Mechanism (3s)

It happens without thinking now, (2s)
the way your hand finds the rail, (2s)
the route your feet know how (2s)
to follow without fail. (4s)

The morning builds itself (2s)
from practiced, automatic parts— (3s)
each motion on its shelf, (2s)
each sequence learned by heart. (4s)

You used to have to concentrate (2s)
on every single turn. (3s)
Now muscle learns to navigate (2s)
what mind need not discern. (4s)

The mechanism runs (2s)
beneath the level of your thought, (3s)
the way a body learns what once (2s)
required all you brought. (4s)

And sometimes you arrive (2s)
at places with no memory of going— (3s)
how you came to be alive (2s)
here, now, without knowing. (4s)

The autopilot hums. (3s)
You're present but not quite. (3s)

The body goes (2s)
where habit knows, (2s)
while you drift through the light. (5s)
