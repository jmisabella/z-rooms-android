Sleep (3s)

You are my perfect escape (1s)
A mirage on the horizon (1s)
I've been chasing you for hours now (1s)
Turning over the same warm spot (1s)
Again and again (1s)
Trying to find the exact position (1s)
The perfect arrangement of limbs (1s)
That will finally let you in (1s)
But you only come (0.15s) when I stop looking (1s)
When I forget (0.15s) I'm supposed to want you (1s)
You arrive on your own terms (1s)
Uninvited, unannounced (1s)
Slipping through the door I left open (1s)
While I was thinking about something else entirely (1s)
The harder I reach for you (1s)
The further you drift (1s)
Like trying to hold water in open palms (1s)
You were never meant to be caught (1s)
Only received (1s)
And I keep forgetting (1s)
That the only way to find you (1s)
Is to stop searching (1s)
