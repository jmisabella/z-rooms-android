The Hour Before (3s)

There's an hour before sleep (2s)
when everything feels possible again. (4s)

Not in the hopeful way. (3s)
More like— (2s)
the day's decisions haven't settled yet, (2s)
the things you said can still be unsaid, (3s)
the future is still soft enough (2s)
to reshape. (4s)

You lie there (2s)
holding it all lightly. (3s)

The conversation you mishandled (2s)
could have gone differently. (3s)
In the dark, (2s)
you can still choose the other door, (2s)
say the better thing, (2s)
walk the path (1s)
that branches from this afternoon. (4s)

Nothing is fixed yet. (3s)

This is when regret (2s)
hasn't hardened into fact. (3s)
When tomorrow (2s)
could fix today. (4s)

You revise the script. (2s)
You take it back. (2s)
You choose again. (3s)

Then sleep comes (2s)
and you wake (2s)
and it's all still true— (3s)
what you said, (1s)
what you didn't, (2s)
the door you took. (4s)

But in that hour before, (3s)
everything stays negotiable. (3s)
The day floats, (2s)
not quite sunk, (2s)
not quite saved. (4s)

You get to live (2s)
in all the versions at once. (3s)
The better ones (2s)
alongside the real one. (4s)

Just for an hour. (3s)
Just before sleep. (3s)

Then it settles. (2s)
Then it sets. (3s)
Then it's tomorrow (2s)
and yesterday is locked, (2s)
and you have to live (2s)
with what you actually did. (5s)

But tonight, (2s)
for now, (2s)
it's still soft. (3s)
Still yours. (3s)
Still (2s)
almost (2s)
fixable. (5s)
