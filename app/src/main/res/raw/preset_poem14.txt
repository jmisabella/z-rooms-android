Twilight's Promise (3s)

You watch the sky soften its insistence, (1s)
that bold blue certainty giving way (1s)
to something gentler, more forgiving (1s)
apricot bleeding into lavender, (1s)
gold dissolving at its edges. (3s)

This is your hour, when the world (1s)
turns its volume down just enough (1s)
to hear yourself think, when light (1s)
doesn't demand but suggests, (1s)
when shadows stretch long and kind (1s)
across everything they touch. (3s)

You've always loved this in between, (1s)
neither day's glare nor night's commitment, (1s)
just this suspension, this breath (1s)
the world takes before deciding (1s)
what comes next. (3s)

The horizon holds colors (1s)
that don't exist at any other hour (1s)
that particular rose that isn't quite pink, (1s)
that blue that's already dreaming of purple, (1s)
light that seems to come from within things (1s)
rather than falling upon them. (4s)

You feel it too, don't you? (1s)
That sense of opening, of doors (1s)
left unlocked, of the day's failures (1s)
softening into maybe next time, (1s)
of possibilities spreading out (1s)
like those colors (1s)
infinite, unnamed, yours. (4s)

This is when anything could happen, (1s)
when the ordinary world reveals (1s)
it was never ordinary at all, (1s)
just waiting for this light (1s)
to show you what it's been hiding (1s)
in plain sight all along. (4s)
