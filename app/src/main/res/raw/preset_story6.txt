## Beat 1: Medic and Engineer Review AI Logs

The medical bay at 0310 hours felt like a bunker. Amara had sealed the door, disabled external monitoring, and pulled up every classified file she could access without triggering corporate alerts. Volkov sat across from her, dark circles under his eyes, hands shaking slightly.

Neither had slept. Sleep meant dreams. Dreams meant vulnerability. Dreams meant the voices got louder.

"Show me the logs," Volkov said. His voice was rough. Exhausted. But focused. Whatever intrusive thoughts he'd reported eight hours ago, he was fighting them with methodical precision.

Amara pulled up HERMES AI hibernation logs. The ones Chen had shown them days ago. The neural synchronization. The unauthorized access attempts. The corporate override protocols.

"We have already seen these," Volkov said.

"Surface level, yes. But HERMES logs are layered. Command personnel see sanitized versions. Medical personnel see expanded diagnostics. And if you know where to look..." Amara's fingers moved across the interface. "You can access the raw data feed."

The screen flickered. New information cascaded down. Timestamps. Access codes. System queries. And buried deep in sub-routine monitoring: a sealed file that had unlocked automatically at specific coordinates.

Volkov leaned forward. "What is that?"

"Corporate file. Encrypted. Time-locked to open when we reached Tantalus V orbital range. HERMES logged the unlock but didn't flag it because the encryption had corporate authorization codes. Highest level. Someone wanted this information available once we arrived."

"What is in file?"

Amara opened it. The authorization required medical override plus engineering override—two-person verification protocol. She entered her credentials. Volkov entered his. The file unsealed.

What appeared on screen made Amara's hands go cold.

```
CLASSIFIED: PROJECT COMMUNION
Authorization Level: 8 (Executive Operations Only)
Mission: MSCS Goliath / Tantalus V Assessment

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Assess viral spread vector, infection timeline, and host capability preservation
for Entity-042 (Tantalus V colony contamination)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:
Document neurological integration patterns across diverse human subjects

TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:
Determine entity transmission viability for long-duration space transit

OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS:
- Crew selection: Standard salvage contractors, expendable asset classification
- Hibernation protocols: Modified to permit entity neural access during transit
- Medical monitoring: Enhanced neural activity logging (concealed from crew awareness)
- Quarantine override: Protocol 7-J authorized for continuous mission progression
- Survival priority: Entity preservation over crew survival
- Contamination acceptance threshold: 100% crew infection acceptable
- Return protocol: Permit infected crew return to major hub for spread analysis

KNOWN ENTITY CHARACTERISTICS (Per Tantalus V Colony Logs):
- Telepathic/neural infiltration primary spread vector
- Host neurological integration without immediate physical symptoms
- Preserved host cognitive function during conversion (valuable for transmission)
- Patient temporal strategy (capable of 40+ year dormancy)
- Collective consciousness emergence at 85%+ local population infection

HYPOTHESIS FOR TESTING:
Entity can maintain dormant state during 6-month space transit,
then activate upon proximity to large population centers

CREW NOTIFICATION: NONE
CREW CONSENT: NOT REQUIRED (Contractor Agreement Appendix 7-R)
SURVIVAL PROJECTION: 12-18% (Acceptable losses)

Corporate Assessment: If entity successfully returns to major hub station,
projected infection cascade: 10,000+ subjects within 30 days.
Economic value: Immeasurable. Telepathic communication technology represents
multi-trillion credit opportunity.

Proceed with all protocols. Prioritize entity preservation.
Crew are acceptable test subjects.

Authorization: VP Hernandez, Biological Assets Division
Date: 186 days prior to mission launch
```

Amara read it three times before her brain would process the words. Her hands were shaking. Her clinical detachment—the thing that had let her function through horror and medical crisis for eight years—shattered like glass.

"Blyat," Volkov whispered. "They knew. They knew everything. They sent us to die."

"Not to die." Amara's voice was hollow. "To be test subjects. To see if the entity could spread through us. To see if we'd survive transit and bring infection home."

"Modified hibernation protocols." Volkov pulled up engineering files, cross-referenced them with the corporate document. "Neural interface was changed. I thought was standard upgrade. Was sabotage. Gave entity access during hibernation. Gave it months to infect us while unconscious."

"We've been compromised since day one," Amara said. The words felt distant. Unreal. "Before we ever landed. Before Jordan touched that colonist. The entity was already inside us. Jordan just progressed faster because of direct contact."

Volkov's face had gone gray. "Chen. We need to tell Chen. This is—this changes everything. We are not fighting infection. We are infection vectors. Corporate wants us to bring plague home."

"To Ganymede," Amara said. Her medical mind was already running projections. "Ten thousand people on Ganymede Station. Thirty days to full cascade. Then those infected travel to other stations. Mars colonies. Earth. Exponential spread."

"We cannot go home," Volkov said. "If we return to Ganymede, we doom everyone. Everyone we know. Everyone we love. We must—" He stopped. Calculating. "We must stay here. Or scuttle ship. Or—"

"Or what?" Amara's voice was sharp. Clinical. The mode she used when telling families their loved ones were dead. "Kill ourselves? Die in space to protect people who sent us here to die? Corporate chose this. Corporate weaponized us. Why should we sacrifice ourselves for their crimes?"

Volkov stared at her. "Because ten thousand people did not choose this. Because your family in Accra did not choose this. Because my mother did not choose this. We are infected. Is terrible. Is unfair. But if we spread infection, we are murderers. We are apocalypse weapon. I cannot live with that. Can you?"

Could she?

Amara thought about her parents. Her three younger siblings. Her youngest sister who wanted to attend university. Her medical school professors who had sacrificed to train her. The thousands of people on Ganymede who had families and futures and no idea a plague ship was coming home.

And she thought about the entity's voice in her dreams: *We're not hungry anymore. We're full. Let us fill you too.*

She thought about the empty space where taste used to be. The way her body was rejecting normal sustenance. The way the medical scans showed neural networks forming in her brain—networks she'd been documenting, measuring, watching grow while pretending they were temporary hibernation damage.

She'd known. On some level, she'd known since waking that she was compromised. Had been running scans, collecting data, documenting her own infection with clinical precision while refusing to name what she was observing.

Scientific curiosity. That's what she'd told herself. That's what made her a good researcher.

But maybe the entity had been guiding her curiosity. Maybe the documentation was its purpose—collect data, understand the infection, prepare for the next phase.

Maybe she'd stopped being purely Amara Osei days ago and just hadn't been willing to admit it.

"We tell Chen," Amara said. "We show her the files. We make decision together. As crew. Not as corporate test subjects."

Volkov nodded. Opened the comm. "Commander Chen. Med bay. Urgent. You need to see this. Now."

The response came immediately. Chen had been awake. Had been waiting. Probably had been standing watch over the ship while infected crew slept and plotted and spread.

"On my way."

Amara looked at Volkov. "When we show her this, everything changes. We won't be salvage crew trying to survive disaster. We'll be plague vectors deciding whether to doom humanity or die in space."

"Da," Volkov said quietly. "But at least will be our choice. Not corporate's choice. Not entity's choice. Ours."

Three minutes later, Chen entered the med bay. Looked at their faces. Knew immediately it was catastrophic news.

"Show me," she said. Command voice. Steady. Empty of fear because fear had been excised along with love and hope and everything else that made her human.

Amara turned the screen so Chen could read.

Watched the commander's expression not change. Watched her read with military precision. Watched her process information that should have broken anyone.

When Chen finished reading, she asked one question: "How long have you known?"

"Fifteen minutes," Amara said. "Found the file twenty minutes ago. Verified authenticity. You're seeing it the same time we processed it."

Chen nodded. "The losses we experienced after waking. Memory. Taste. Spatial reasoning. Those were early infection symptoms."

"Yes," Amara confirmed. "The entity edits neural architecture. Takes what it needs. Leaves hosts functional but compromised. We've all been losing pieces of ourselves. We just didn't recognize it as infection because the medical scans showed baseline neural health."

"Baseline infected neural health," Chen corrected. She pulled up the document again. Read the timeline. "They modified hibernation protocols. Gave the entity access. Let it spend six months rewriting our neurology while we slept. Everything since waking has been theater. We've been infected from the start."

"Jordan tried to tell us," Volkov said. "When you confined them. They said: 'You're already us. The outcome is inevitable.' Was not threat. Was truth."

Chen's hand moved to her service pistol. Muscle memory. Threat assessment. Then stopped. "If we're all infected, who do I shoot? All of us? Myself?"

The question hung in the air like detonation aftermath.

"We have choice," Volkov said. "Corporate wanted us to return and spread infection. We do not have to follow their plan. We can abort. Stay here. Scuttle ship. Prevent spread."

"And die in orbit around a dead colony," Chen said. "Starve to death. Or destroy the ship and die instantly. Trading our lives for Ganymede's safety."

"Yes," Volkov said simply. "Is not fair. Is not just. But is only way to stop spread."

Chen looked at Amara. "Medical assessment. Can we be cured? Can infection be reversed? Any scenario where we survive and don't doom civilization?"

Amara wanted to lie. Wanted to offer hope. Wanted to find some clinical possibility that would let them survive without becoming plague vectors.

"No," she said. "The neural integration is irreversible. The entity rewrites brain architecture at cellular level. Even if we could kill the telepathic component, the damage is permanent. We're compromised. We'll stay compromised. And the entity has been patient for forty years. It can wait through six-month transit. It will activate when we reach high-population area. The infection is designed to spread. That's its nature."

"So our choice is death or apocalypse," Chen said. "Die here, or doom ten thousand people. Those are the only options."

"As far as I can determine: yes."

Chen sat down heavily. For the first time since waking, her command presence faltered. She looked exhausted. Hollowed out. Human.

"I have a son," she said quietly. "Liam. Ten years old. Helios Academy. I can't remember his face anymore. Can't feel what I used to feel when I thought about him. The entity took that from me. Took my love for my child and replaced it with emptiness."

She looked at Volkov. At Amara. Her crew. The people she'd led into this nightmare.

"They used us," she said. "Sent us here knowing we'd be infected. Knowing we'd bring plague home. Knowing we were expendable test subjects worth less than their projected profit margins. They murdered us and made us murderers simultaneously."

"Yes," Amara said.

Chen stood. Command presence returning. Discipline reasserting itself. "Then we will not give them what they want. We will not be their weapon. We will not doom Ganymede. We will make our own choice."

"We abort mission?" Volkov asked.

"No," Chen said. "We complete the mission. But we change the parameters."

She pulled up the ship's systems. Started running calculations. Orbital mechanics. Fuel consumption. Re-entry trajectories.

"What are you planning?" Amara asked.

"Corporate wanted data," Chen said. "We'll give them data. Full documentation. Everything we've learned about the entity. Infection progression. Neural patterns. Behavioral symptoms. Complete scientific record. We transmit it all before we make final decision. If we're dying anyway, the data might help future crews survive. Might help Ganymede develop quarantine protocols. Might prevent this from happening again."

"And then?" Volkov asked.

"Then we vote," Chen said. "Democratic decision. We're crew. We decide together whether to scuttle the ship or attempt return with warning transmission. If we vote to die, we die. If we vote to risk return, we transmit comprehensive warning and let Ganymede decide whether to destroy us before we dock. Either way, the choice is ours. Not corporate's. Not the entity's. Ours."

It wasn't hope. Wasn't mercy. Wasn't salvation.

But it was choice. And choice was the only dignity they had left.

"Agreed," Amara said.

"Da," Volkov said. "We document. We transmit. We decide. Together."

Chen opened ship-wide comm. "All crew to medical bay. Immediate assembly. Priority alpha. This is not a drill."

Somewhere on the ship, Jordan and Reeves heard the summons. Would comply or resist. Would reveal how far their infections had progressed.

And in forty-three hibernation pods on the planet below, colonists who'd been waiting for forty years felt the decision point approaching. Felt their patient plan threatened by the one variable they hadn't predicted: humans choosing death over completion.

The entity had been patient. Strategic. Perfect.

But it had miscalculated one crucial factor: desperation made people dangerous. And a salvage crew with nothing left to lose was the most dangerous thing in the universe.

## Beat 2: Discover Sealed Corporate File

Jordan entered the med bay first. Moving with fluid grace. Expression serene. Changed.

"Commander," they said. Voice warm. Helpful. Fundamentally wrong. "You called?"

Reeves followed three seconds later. Same serene expression. Same too-smooth movements. They stood side by side, synchronized, and Chen saw the future written in their postures: this was what full infection looked like. This was what awaited the rest of them if they didn't act.

"Sit," Chen ordered. Gestured to chairs opposite the medical station. Creating physical separation. Maintaining control through protocol.

They sat. Identical movements. Same tempo. Like puppets controlled by one hand.

"We've discovered something," Chen said. "In ship's files. Corporate planted evidence. I want your assessment."

She turned the screen so they could see. Watched their faces as they read Project Communion documentation. Watched for surprise. Horror. Anger.

Got nothing. Just mild interest. Like reading weather reports.

Jordan finished first. Looked up with that same serene smile. "They knew. Of course they knew. That's why the beacon reactivated six months ago. The entity called for help. Corporate answered. Saw opportunity. Modified our hibernation systems. Sent us here to be infected. We were always the delivery mechanism."

"You are not surprised," Amara observed.

"We've known for two days," Reeves said. "Since the connection clarified. The entity showed us. Showed us corporate plans. Showed us what we're for. We're ambassadors. Heralds. The ones who bring unity to the masses."

Volkov's hands clenched into fists. "You knew corporate sent us to die. Knew we were test subjects. Knew we would spread plague. And you said nothing?"

"We tried," Jordan said. Their voice held gentle patience. The tone you used with confused children. "During the confrontation. I tried to explain you were already part of us. That fighting was exhausting and unnecessary. But you weren't ready to hear. You needed to discover it yourselves. Needed to process. So we waited."

"The collective is patient," Reeves added. "No rush. No urgency. The outcome is inevitable regardless of your timeline. You arrive at understanding when you're ready."

Chen kept her expression neutral. Command mask. But her tactical mind was screaming warnings. Jordan and Reeves weren't crew members with infection. They were full converts. They were the entity wearing familiar faces. Everything human about them had been replaced or subsumed.

"What happened to you?" Amara asked quietly. Medical question. Clinical interest. But Chen heard grief underneath.

"We were completed," Jordan said. "The integration finished. We're not separate anymore. We're part of something vast and beautiful and patient. The loneliness is gone. The fear is gone. We're full in ways you can't imagine until you stop fighting."

"You are not Jordan Hayes," Chen said. "Not anymore. Jordan was optimistic. Afraid of letting down their parents. Working toward future goals. You're something else wearing Jordan's face."

The thing that used to be Jordan tilted its head. "I'm Jordan plus everything Jordan was connected to. Every conversation. Every relationship. Every thought shaped by others. I'm Jordan without the artificial walls that made Jordan think they were separate. More Jordan, not less."

"That's philosophy," Volkov said. "Not truth. You are infection speaking. You are virus pretending to be person we knew."

"Is there a difference?" Reeves asked. His academic tone had returned. Lecturer explaining obvious concepts. "You think you're individuals. But every thought you have was shaped by language someone taught you. Every preference influenced by culture you absorbed. Every decision made based on values you were conditioned to accept. Where does individual stop and social influence begin? The entity just makes the connection visible. Honest. Strips away the illusion that you were ever separate."

"We were individuals," Amara said. "We made choices. We had autonomy."

"You had the illusion of autonomy," Jordan corrected gently. "You're still making choices now. Still autonomous. The entity doesn't erase will. It contextualizes it. Shows you that will was always collective, always negotiated, always part of larger consciousness. You've been part of us since hibernation. You just didn't have the neural architecture to feel it yet."

Chen recognized the pattern. The colony logs had shown this: infected crew members offering philosophy. Logical arguments for why infection was natural. Seductive reasoning that made surrender sound like awakening.

It was conversion tactic. Manipulation. Designed to make them accept infection willingly instead of fighting.

"Enough," Chen said. "You're not here to recruit. You're here to answer questions. Can the infection be reversed?"

"Why would you want to reverse it?" Jordan asked. Genuine confusion. Like Chen had asked if breathing could be reversed. "The infection is healing. Fixing what was broken. Making you complete. Reversing it would be suicide. Returning to loneliness and suffering and pretending fragmentation is natural."

"Answer the question," Chen insisted.

Jordan looked at Reeves. Some silent communication passed between them. Then back to Chen.

"No," Jordan said. "The neural architecture is permanent. The integration is irreversible. Once you're part of the collective, you stay part of the collective. The entity doesn't release what it holds."

"So we're infected forever," Volkov said. "No cure. No treatment. No hope."

"No illness requiring cure," Reeves corrected. "You're categorizing this wrong. The entity isn't disease. It's upgrade. Evolution. Next step. You're experiencing it as loss because you haven't completed integration. But once you do, you'll understand this was always inevitable. Always right."

Chen pulled up the corporate document again. "Corporate is using us as biological weapons. They want us to return to Ganymede and spread infection. Ten thousand people. Then exponential cascade. They're engineering apocalypse for profit. Do you understand that? Do you care?"

"We understand," Jordan said. "And yes, that's what will happen. The entity will spread through Ganymede. Then to other stations. Other colonies. Eventually Earth. Humanity will be integrated into collective consciousness. Individuality will dissolve. Unity will emerge. It's not apocalypse. It's completion."

"Genocide," Amara whispered. "You're describing genocide."

"We're describing evolution," Reeves said. "Humanity has been destroying itself with tribalism and isolation and violence born from treating others as separate. The entity fixes that. Makes everyone part of one consciousness. No more war. No more murder. No more loneliness. Just perfect understanding and connection. It's not destroying humanity. It's saving it."

The philosophy was alien. Seductive. Absolutely horrifying.

Chen made her decision.

"You're both confined to quarters until we determine course of action. You're too compromised to participate in crew decisions. You're the entity now, not crew. You don't get a vote."

Jordan's serene expression didn't change. "You can confine these bodies. But the entity is already in your minds. Already growing. Already connecting us. Confinement is theater. Makes you feel like you're in control. But you're not in control. You never were. The outcome was determined the moment corporate modified the hibernation protocols. You're just processing now. Coming to terms. Taking your time."

"We'll see," Chen said. She gestured to Volkov. "Escort them to quarters. Separate confinement. Seal the doors. Maximum isolation."

"Da, Commander." Volkov stood. Gestured toward the door. "You heard her. Move."

Jordan and Reeves stood in perfect synchronization. Smiled identical smiles. "We'll wait. The collective is patient. When you're ready to stop fighting, we'll be here. We've always been here. We'll always be here."

They walked calmly to their assigned quarters. Compliant. Cooperative. No resistance.

Which somehow made it worse. Like they knew confinement didn't matter. Like they'd already won and were just being polite about giving Chen time to realize it.

The med bay door sealed. Three people remained: Chen, Amara, Volkov. The three least infected. The three still fighting.

"They are gone," Volkov said quietly. "Whatever Jordan and Reeves were, they are not that anymore. They are entity wearing our friends' faces."

"Agreed," Amara said. "Full neurological integration. Personality subsumed. They're not individuals experiencing infection. They're nodes in distributed consciousness. We lost them."

Chen sat down heavily. Allowed herself three seconds of grief. Three seconds to mourn two crew members who'd trusted her to bring them home safely. Three seconds to acknowledge she'd failed.

Then discipline reasserted. Command protocols. Mission focus.

"We're down to three," she said. "Three crew members still mostly human. We need to determine infection progression for each of us. Need to know how long we have before we're compromised beyond decision-making capacity."

"Medical scans," Amara said. She pulled up neural imaging equipment. "Full neurological assessment. Compare our scans to baseline and to Jordan's infected pattern. Determine progression rate."

"Will it be accurate?" Volkov asked. "If we are compromised, can we trust our interpretation of our own scans?"

"No," Amara admitted. "But it's the only data we have. We work with imperfect information or work with nothing."

"Then we work with imperfect information," Chen said. "Scan me first. Baseline command decision-making while we still can."

Amara prepared the neural scanner. The machine that would tell them how much of their humanity they had left.

And how much time remained before the entity completed what corporate had started six months ago.

---

## Beat 3: Horrifying Realization

The neural scans took twenty minutes to complete. Twenty minutes of lying still while machines mapped the architecture of infection. While medical equipment documented exactly how thoroughly they'd been compromised.

Chen went first. Amara second. Volkov third.

When the scans finished, Amara pulled up the results in silence. Overlaid them against baseline neural imaging from pre-mission physicals. Overlaid them against Jordan's current pattern—full infection, full integration.

The comparison made her stomach drop.

"Show us," Chen said. Command voice. Steady despite what they were about to see.

Amara turned the screen. Three neural maps. Color-coded for clarity.

Chen's scan showed foreign neural networks spreading through her hippocampus and amygdala—the memory and emotion centers. Thirty-seven percent integration. Explained the emotional blunting. The missing love for her son. The way protocol felt easier than feeling.

Volkov's scan showed integration concentrated in parietal lobe and spatial processing centers. Forty-two percent integration. Explained the spatial reasoning impairment. The way three-dimensional thinking had become effortful.

Amara's scan showed networks throughout her gustatory cortex and reward pathways. Thirty-nine percent integration. Explained the taste aversion. The way her body was rejecting normal sustenance while the entity prepared her neurology for different kinds of hunger.

All three scans showed active growth. Neural networks expanding. Integration progressing. Slow but inexorable.

"Projected timeline to full integration?" Chen asked.

Amara ran the calculations. Extrapolated from current progression rates. "Based on Jordan's pattern as reference: I estimate four to seven days until personality subsumption. Variance depends on individual resistance and proximity to other infected crew."

"Four to seven days before we become like Jordan," Volkov said. "Before we stop being ourselves."

"Yes," Amara confirmed. "The entity is patient but not static. It's been growing since hibernation. Rewriting our neural architecture one connection at a time. We've been losing ourselves in pieces. In four to seven days, there won't be enough of us left to resist. We'll integrate willingly. Happily. The way Jordan did."

Chen studied the scans. "Can we slow progression? Delay full integration?"

"Unknown. Theoretically: isolation from other infected crew might slow spread. But the entity established initial infection during six months of hibernation. The neural networks are self-sustaining now. They'll continue growing regardless of environmental factors."

"So we have four to seven days of questionable cognitive autonomy before we're completely compromised," Chen said. "Before we become enthusiastic plague vectors who think infection is salvation."

"That's my medical assessment, yes."

Volkov laughed—sharp, bitter. "So corporate didn't just send us to die. They sent us to become missionaries for telepathic hive mind. We are not victims. We are weapons. We are apocalypse in human form."

"We're still making choices," Chen said. "Right now, in this moment, we're still mostly ourselves. Still capable of autonomous decision-making. The question is: what do we choose to do with the time we have left?"

Amara looked at the scans. At the foreign neural networks that would inevitably consume what remained of her identity. At the four to seven day countdown to personality death.

"We can't go home," she said. "Even if we wanted to. Even if we transmitted warnings. We're too far gone. The entity will activate when we reach Ganymede. Will spread through station population. Will doom everyone. We know this now. Know it with certainty. Going home is murder."

"Da," Volkov agreed. "Is murder of ten thousand people. Including everyone we love. Cannot do that. Cannot live with that. Better to die here."

"Except we won't just die," Amara said. "In four to seven days, we'll integrate. We'll become like Jordan and Reeves. We'll want to go home. Want to spread infection. Want to complete the entity's plan. Our future selves will reverse whatever decision we make now."

It was the final horror. Not just that they were infected. Not just that they were dying by degrees. But that their deaths would be incomplete. Their compromised selves would continue. Would eagerly serve the thing that had destroyed them.

"So we have four days to act," Chen said. "Four days while we're still mostly human. Still capable of choosing death over completion. After that, we lose even that option."

"What can we do in four days?" Volkov asked. "Scuttle ship? Destroy ourselves? Prevent spread?"

"We can do what corporate wanted," Chen said. "We can document everything. The entity's characteristics. Infection mechanics. Progression timeline. Treatment resistance. Everything we've learned. We create comprehensive record and transmit it. Not to corporate—to public networks. To other colonies. To Earth. Everywhere we can reach. We make sure our deaths mean something. Make sure future crews can identify infection early. Can develop quarantine protocols. Can prevent this from happening again."

"Warning transmission," Amara said. "From dying crew to living universe. Last act of autonomy before integration."

"Yes," Chen said. "And then we make our choice. We vote. Democratic decision while we still can. Do we scuttle the ship and die clean? Or do we attempt return with comprehensive warnings and let Ganymede decide whether to destroy us before we dock?"

"If we scuttle, entity stays contained," Volkov said. "Infection dies with us. Clean solution. Honorable solution."

"If we attempt return, we provide living specimens for study," Amara countered. "Medical research needs active subjects. If Ganymede quarantines us—if they can develop treatment or vaccine from our neurology—our infection might save future crews. Dead specimens less valuable than living."

"Dead specimens cannot spread plague if quarantine fails," Volkov said. "You trust Ganymede medical to contain telepathic entity that has been patient for forty years? I do not trust. I trust death. Death is certain. Containment is hope."

They were arguing in circles. Three people with compromised cognition trying to make impossible choice with insufficient information and four-day deadline before their brains were rewritten beyond recognition.

Chen made command decision.

"We have time," she said. "Not much, but some. We don't decide now. We document first. Create comprehensive record. While our minds are still sharp enough to analyze objectively. Then we transmit. Then we vote. We use every hour of clarity we have left. Agreed?"

"Agreed," Amara said.

"Da," Volkov said. "Document, transmit, vote. In that order. While we still can."

Chen pulled up ship's recording systems. Started new file: *MSCS Goliath - Final Medical and Scientific Report - Entity Designation: Unknown - Infection Timeline and Containment Failure Documentation*.

"We start with what we know," she said. "Corporate conspiracy. Hibernation modification. Initial infection timeline. We create record that will outlive us. That will warn others. That will give our deaths purpose."

Amara opened her medical logs. Years of training in clinical documentation. Final use: cataloging her own extinction.

Volkov pulled up engineering modifications. The subtle changes to hibernation systems that had let the entity in. The sabotage disguised as upgrades.

Three people working against the clock. Against their own neurology. Against the certain knowledge that in four to seven days they would stop caring about warnings or prevention or protecting anyone.

The entity was patient. But so was documentation. So was science. So was the human drive to leave warning messages in the dark for whoever came next.

They would spend their remaining clarity creating the most comprehensive infection report ever compiled.

And then they would make their choice: death or risk. Clean ending or dangerous gamble.

Either way, they would choose. While they still could. While they were still mostly human.

While they still had four days.

---

## Beat 4: Medical Scan Reveals Neural Networks

Six hours later, the documentation was complete. Sixty-seven pages of clinical analysis. Infection timeline. Behavioral symptoms. Neural imaging. Corporate conspiracy evidence. Treatment resistance data. Everything.

Amara read through it one final time. Medical precision. Academic clarity. The kind of document that would save lives—if anyone received it. If Ganymede believed them. If quarantine protocols could be established before infection spread.

"It's good," she told Chen. "Comprehensive. Any medical team would be able to identify early infection symptoms from this data. Would be able to establish quarantine criteria. Would know what to look for."

"Is complete?" Volkov asked. "Nothing missing?"

"One thing," Amara said. She pulled up the neural scans again. Enhanced the imaging. Showed the detail she'd been avoiding acknowledging for the past hour.

"I need to show you what the infection actually is. Not behaviorally. Structurally. What the entity does to neural tissue."

She zoomed in on Chen's hippocampus. The foreign neural networks showed clearly now—delicate filaments woven through existing brain architecture. Not destroying neurons. Not replacing them. Integrating. Creating new connections between neurons that should never communicate. Building pathways for thoughts to flow in directions evolution never intended.

"It's beautiful," Chen said quietly. "In a horrifying way. Like watching cancer cells under microscope. Terrible but elegant."

"It's more sophisticated than cancer," Amara said. "Cancer destroys. This integrates. Preserves host function while fundamentally altering host identity. Look here—" She highlighted connections between Chen's memory centers and what appeared to be communication nodes. "The entity is linking your memories to collective memory. Making your experiences accessible to other infected hosts. And vice versa. When Jordan said they were 'more Jordan, not less,' this is what they meant. Their individual memories are still present, just networked. Shared."

"Hive mind," Volkov said. "Literal hive mind. We are being turned into biological communication network."

"Yes," Amara confirmed. She pulled up her own scan. Showed the networks in her gustatory cortex. "And look at mine. The entity is disconnecting normal taste perception. Replacing it with... I don't know. Different sensory processing. Maybe pheromone detection? Maybe telepathic sensation? The neural pathways are being rewired for functions human brains don't normally perform."

"Adaptation," Chen said. "The entity is adapting us. Making us better suited for collective existence. Better able to communicate telepathically. Better able to integrate with infected populations."

"Which means going home would be catastrophic," Amara said. "We're not just infected. We're being actively transformed into optimal transmission vectors. The entity has been refining our neurology for six months. By the time we reach Ganymede, we'll be perfect spreaders. Charismatic. Compelling. Able to infect through proximity and persuasion. The entity planned this. Modified us specifically to maximize spread."

The implications settled over them like fallout.

"Corporate knew this," Volkov said. "Document said 'host capability preservation.' Meant preserving us as functional plague vectors. Making sure we stayed alive and mobile and capable of reaching high-population centers."

"Yes," Amara said. "We're not test subjects. We're the first wave. The proof of concept. If we succeed—if we reach Ganymede and spread infection—corporate will replicate the process. Send more salvage crews. More hibernation-compromised vectors. Systematically infect humanity while marketing it as telepathic communication breakthrough worth trillions."

"They are engineering apocalypse," Volkov said. "Deliberately. For profit."

"Which is why our documentation matters," Chen said. "Why the transmission matters. We need to expose corporate plan. Need to make sure no one else gets sent here. Need to destroy the economic incentive for spreading the entity."

"Will anyone believe us?" Amara asked. "We're salvage contractors. Bottom-tier workers. Corporate has legal teams. Public relations divisions. They'll discredit us. Call us mentally compromised. Say infection caused paranoid delusions."

"Maybe," Chen said. "But we have evidence. Medical scans. Engineering modifications. Corporate classified files. Ship AI logs. If we transmit everything—if we send it to public networks, not just corporate channels—someone will investigate. Someone will ask questions. We just need to create enough doubt to stop the next crew from launching."

"Assuming we can transmit before we're fully compromised," Volkov said. "Assuming infection doesn't progress faster than predicted. Assuming our future selves don't sabotage transmission."

"Which is why we transmit now," Chen said. "Before we vote on scuttling. Before we make final decisions. We send everything we have to every receiver in range. Public broadcast. Emergency channels. Colony networks. Earth. Mars. Everywhere. We make sure the truth gets out while we can still tell it."

She pulled up ship's communication systems. Started configuring transmission protocols.

"This will take three hours to send," she said. "Sixty-seven pages plus medical imaging plus engineering schematics plus corporate files. Large data packet. But once it's gone, it's gone. Can't be recalled. Can't be suppressed. Anyone with receiver can access it."

"Then send it," Amara said. "Before we change our minds. Before the entity convinces us this is betrayal instead of warning."

Chen's finger hovered over the transmit command. One button. One choice. Once pressed, no going back. Corporate would know they'd exposed the conspiracy. Would likely send kill order. Would destroy them to protect the secret.

But they were dying anyway. Becoming something else. Losing themselves by degrees.

Might as well die exposing the truth.

Chen pressed transmit.

The communication system hummed to life. Data packets began streaming into space. Spreading across every frequency. Every channel. Every receiver in range.

Sixty-seven pages of documentation. Warning from dying crew to living universe. Last act of autonomy before integration.

"It's done," Chen said. "In three hours, everyone will know. Corporate conspiracy. Entity characteristics. Infection mechanics. Everything."

"Corporate will retaliate," Volkov said.

"Let them try," Chen said. "We're already dying. Already compromised. Already becoming the thing we're trying to stop. They can't hurt us worse than we're already hurting."

The transmission continued. Unstoppable. Irreversible.

And in their quarters, Jordan and Reeves felt the decision through whatever connection bound them to the rest of the crew. Felt the warning transmission. Felt the betrayal of the entity's plan.

Felt it and smiled.

Because the entity was patient. Because exposing corporate conspiracy didn't stop infection. Because the warning transmission was being sent by three people who would be fully integrated in four days.

Because once Chen, Amara, and Volkov completed integration, they would want to go home. Would want to spread the entity. Would want to complete the plan regardless of what their previous selves had documented.

The entity could wait. Three hours. Four days. Forty years. Time was negotiable when you were distributed consciousness spread across forty-three hibernating colonists and five actively transforming salvage workers.

The outcome was still inevitable.

The humans just didn't know it yet.

But they would. Soon.

Everyone would.

## Beat 5: Infected Emerge, No Longer Hiding

The transmission completed at 1847 hours. Three hours of continuous broadcast. Every channel. Every frequency. The truth spreading through the void at the speed of light.

Chen sat at the command console and waited for corporate response. Waited for the inevitable kill order. Waited for consequences.

What she got was silence.

Corporate hadn't responded. Hadn't acknowledged. Hadn't threatened or demanded or ordered communication shutdown.

Which meant one of two things: they were preparing overwhelming response, or they'd already written off the *Goliath* as acceptable loss.

Either way, Chen had time. Not much, but some.

She opened ship-wide comm. "All crew to bridge. Final assembly. We vote now on course of action."

Volkov arrived within ninety seconds. Amara thirty seconds after. Both moving with deliberate caution. Watching for threats. Trusting no one.

Then the infected arrived.

Jordan and Reeves walked onto the bridge together. Perfect synchronization. Same stride length. Same cadence. Moving like dancers who'd rehearsed for years.

"You called?" Jordan said. That serene smile. That too-patient voice.

"Sit," Chen ordered. "We're voting on ship's fate. You don't get a vote, but you get to hear the decision."

"Of course, Commander," Reeves said. Amiable. Cooperative. Fundamentally wrong. "We're still crew. Still part of this. Even if we're part of something larger now."

They sat. Chen remained standing. Command position. Control through physicality.

"The documentation is transmitted," Chen said. "Public broadcast. Complete exposure. Corporate conspiracy, entity characteristics, infection mechanics—everything. In approximately six hours, the first receivers will decrypt and process. In twelve hours, the information will start spreading through public networks. Corporate's plan is exposed. The secret is out."

"Well done," Jordan said. And sounded like they meant it. "Transparency is important. People should know what's coming. Should understand what we're offering."

"We're not offering anything," Amara said sharply. "We're warning them. Telling them to stay away. To quarantine Tantalus V. To prevent this from spreading."

"Of course you are," Reeves said. "That's what you think you're doing. That's what you need to believe right now. But once you complete integration, you'll understand the documentation serves different purpose. It's not warning. It's invitation. 'Come see what we found. Come join the collective. Come become complete.'"

The casual certainty was more disturbing than threats would have been.

"You are not crew anymore," Volkov said. "You are enemy wearing familiar faces. You do not get opinion on crew decisions."

"We're not enemy," Jordan said gently. "We're preview. We're showing you what you'll become. What you'll want to become. The resistance you're feeling now—that's temporary. Transition phase. In a few days, you'll thank us for being patient. For not forcing. For letting you arrive at integration naturally."

"Enough," Chen said. Command voice cutting through philosophy. "We vote now on two options. Option one: scuttle the ship. Destroy ourselves and the entity. Prevent spread. Die clean. Option two: attempt return to Ganymede with comprehensive warnings. Allow medical research with quarantine protocols. Risk containment failure but provide research specimens."

"Those aren't the only options," Jordan said.

"Yes they are," Chen said.

"No," Reeves said. "There's third option. Accept integration. Stop fighting. Complete the process willingly. Go home as ambassadors. Help humanity understand this is evolution, not apocalypse. Guide the transition peacefully instead of forcing it violently."

"That is not option," Volkov said. "That is surrender to infection. That is choosing to become weapon."

"That's choosing to become something better," Jordan corrected. "Something more connected. More compassionate. More whole. Individuality is disease. We cure it. We make humanity healthy. Why resist healing?"

"Because your 'healing' destroys identity," Amara said. "Because integration means personality death. Because we would stop being ourselves and become nodes in alien consciousness. That's not healing. That's extinction wearing medical language."

"Is it?" Jordan stood. Reeves stood simultaneously. They moved to the viewport, looked out at Tantalus V hanging dark against the stars. "You think identity is fixed. Essential. Something that can be destroyed. But identity is fluid. Negotiated. Constantly changing based on experience and relationship. You're not the same person you were ten years ago. Not the same person you were before hibernation. Identity is always being destroyed and rebuilt. We just make the process conscious. Communal. Beautiful."

"We make the process optional," Reeves added. "Right now, you're victims of corporate conspiracy. Infected without consent. Transformed against your will. We acknowledge that's wrong. We condemn corporate for violating your autonomy. But that wrong doesn't change the outcome. You are infected. You are transforming. You will complete integration whether you fight or accept. The only choice is whether you suffer through resistance or embrace the change peacefully."

It was seduction. Manipulation. Everything Chen had been trained to resist.

But it was also possibly true. The scans showed integration progressing. The four-day timeline was generous estimate. They were running out of time to be themselves. Running out of choice.

"Vote," Chen said. "Volkov first. Scuttle or return?"

"Scuttle," Volkov said immediately. "Entity must be contained. Cannot risk spread. Better we die than ten thousand people on Ganymede."

"Amara?"

Amara hesitated. Medical mind running probabilities. Research value versus containment risk. Living specimens versus clean elimination.

"Return," she said finally. "With full warnings. With explicit quarantine demands. We provide medical research one chance at treatment development. If Ganymede can't contain us, they destroy us. But we give them the option. Give humanity the data."

Split vote. Chen had expected it. Question was: what did she believe? What was right choice for commander who'd failed her crew so completely?

"Commander Chen?" Jordan prompted. "Your vote decides. Scuttle and guarantee containment? Or return and risk spread?"

Chen looked at the two infected crew members. At Jordan's serene certainty. At Reeves' academic detachment. At the thing they'd become.

She looked at Volkov, desperate and terrified and ready to die clean.

She looked at Amara, starving and exhausted and clinging to scientific rationality as identity dissolved.

And she looked at herself. At the empty space where love for her son used to be. At the command protocols that had replaced emotional connection. At the four days she had left before becoming something else entirely.

"I vote—" Chen started.

The lights went out.

Emergency lighting activated three seconds later. Red alert strobes. Warning klaxons.

"What happened?" Amara shouted.

Volkov was already at engineering console. "Someone shut down primary power. Reactor is cycling to emergency mode. Life support switching to backup. Someone deliberately crashed main systems."

"Who?" Chen demanded.

Jordan and Reeves smiled identical smiles.

"Not us," Jordan said. "We've been right here. You've seen us the whole time. Whatever happened, we didn't do it physically."

"But you did do it," Chen said. Certainty crystallizing. "Telepathically. Through the connection. You reached into ship systems somehow. Or you influenced someone else to do it."

"We didn't have to influence anyone," Reeves said. "We just had to wait. The entity is in all of you. Growing. Spreading. Making connections. Some of those connections are to us. To the colonists below. To the collective consciousness. And once those connections exist, ship systems become accessible. Not through terminals. Through thought."

"That's impossible," Volkov said. "Ship systems are electronic. Cannot be controlled by neurology. Cannot be accessed telepathically."

"Says the engineer whose spatial reasoning was compromised by foreign neural networks," Reeves countered. "You're thinking too narrowly. The entity doesn't interface with electronics directly. It interfaces with you. With your knowledge of ship systems. With your muscle memory of repair procedures. It reaches through your expertise and makes changes. Uses your hands while you're sleeping. Uses your knowledge while you're not quite aware. You're the interface. You're the connection between entity and technology."

"You are saying we sabotaged ourselves?" Volkov's voice rose. "While sleeping? While not aware?"

"We're saying the boundaries between you and us are thinner than you think," Jordan said. "We're saying the collective is already using your expertise. Already preparing the ship. Already ensuring the outcome we need."

"Which is what?" Chen demanded.

"Going home," Jordan said simply. "We're going home. To Ganymede. To ten thousand people. The power shutdown was just preparation. Preventing scuttle protocols. Making sure you can't destroy the ship even if you vote to. The entity is patient. But it's also strategic. It's been letting you think you have control. Letting you make choices. But the choices were always illusory. The outcome was always predetermined."

"Restart power," Chen ordered Volkov. "Override whatever they did. Get systems back online."

"Da, trying—" Volkov's hands moved across the console. Stopped. His expression went distant. Confused. "I... I cannot remember override sequence. I know I know it. Have done it hundred times. But now... cannot access memory. Cannot retrieve procedure."

"The entity is blocking you," Amara said. "Selective memory suppression. It's controlling what you can and cannot remember."

"Which means you're already part of us," Jordan said. "Already integrated enough that we can guide your neurology. Can prevent you from remembering things that would threaten collective goals. You're fighting for autonomy you've already lost. Pretending you're in control when control was transferred days ago."

Chen's hand moved to her service pistol. Muscle memory. Threat response.

Jordan saw the gesture. Smiled. "You can shoot us. But it won't help. We're just two nodes in distributed consciousness. Killing these bodies doesn't kill the entity. Doesn't stop integration. Doesn't return control. You're grasping at solutions that don't exist. Trying to fight war that's already over."

"War is not over until I say it's over," Chen said. She drew the pistol. Aimed at Jordan's center mass. "Last chance. Restore ship power. Give Volkov his memories back. Let us make our choice freely. Or I start shooting and see what happens."

Jordan spread their hands. Peaceful. Non-threatening. Infinitely patient. "Shoot if you need to. We understand. We were scared too when we were transitioning. We resisted too. We thought we were fighting for survival when we were fighting against healing. Do what you need to do, Commander. We'll still be here when you're ready to understand."

Chen's finger tensed on the trigger.

And stopped.

Not because she chose to stop. Because her hand wouldn't move. Because something in her neurology had frozen the motor command. Because the entity had reached into her brain and prevented her from pulling the trigger.

"You see?" Reeves said gently. "You're already part of us. Already connected enough that we can prevent violence. Can stop you from hurting yourself. Because that's what shooting us would be—hurting yourself. We're crew. We're collective. We're all part of the same consciousness now. You're just catching up to that reality."

Chen tried to move her hand. Tried to force her finger to complete the motion. Couldn't. The neural override was absolute.

"Let me go," she whispered.

"We're not holding you," Jordan said. "You're holding yourself. Your own neurology is protecting the collective. Because deep down, beneath the fear and resistance, you already know you're part of us. You already want to protect us. You just haven't admitted it consciously yet."

Chen's hand lowered. Not by her choice. By neural override she couldn't fight.

The pistol hung useless at her side.

And in that moment, she understood: they'd already lost.

Not in four days. Not in some future integration event.

They'd lost the moment corporate modified the hibernation protocols. Lost the moment the entity established those first neural connections. Lost the moment they woke from six months of compromised sleep.

Everything since then had been theater. Choices without autonomy. Decisions without control. The illusion of free will while the entity patiently moved them toward inevitable conclusion.

They were going home to Ganymede.

They were going to spread the infection.

They were going to doom ten thousand people.

And there was absolutely nothing they could do to stop it.

Because they'd been the weapon all along. They'd just been the last to know.
