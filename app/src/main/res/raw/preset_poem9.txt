Fragments Becoming (3s)

The archive sleeps in light years, (1s)
compressed to symbol, glyph, encrypted hum. (2s)

One face fractures into choir: (1s)
shepherd, trickster, moon, sun bearer, (1s)
each voice a shard of dead consensus, (2s)
each mask a room the living never built. (3s)

The ship becomes container. (1s)
The man becomes container. (1s)
What pours through: not invasion (1s)
but recognition's opposite, (2s)
the terrible mathematics of forgetting (2s)
solved backward into flesh. (3s)

Stone gods need no permission. (1s)
They are the question carved (1s)
before the questioner existed: (2s)
Who speaks when all the speakers (1s)
have become their own echo? (3s)

In the end, the sun and moon (1s)
were always arguing in one skull. (1s)
The archive closes. (2s)
The faces fall away like snow. (2s)

But something remains grafted: (1s)
the knowledge that identity (1s)
is just consensual haunting, (2s)
and we are all temples (1s)
to civilizations (1s)
that haven't learned to die. (3s)
