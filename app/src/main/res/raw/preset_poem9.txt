The Choir (3s)

Sometimes you speak in unison— (2s)
all the voices aligned, (2s)
a single thought, a common tone, (2s)
one self, one settled mind. (4s)

But other times they split apart, (2s)
each singing their own line. (3s)
A discord in the heart, (2s)
no harmony to find. (4s)

One says stay, another go. (2s)
One rages, one withdraws. (3s)
They argue what you know (2s)
and question every cause. (4s)

You've tried to make them one again, (2s)
to choose a single voice. (3s)
But the choir won't abstain (2s)
from making their own choice. (4s)

Maybe you're not meant (2s)
to sing with just one sound. (3s)
Maybe what you've spent (2s)
trying to quiet down (4s)

is not a flaw to fix (2s)
but the chorus of your truth— (3s)
all these selves that mix (2s)
and shift from root to root. (4s)

Not fragmented. (2s)
Not undone. (3s)

Just many voices (2s)
learning how to become one. (5s)
