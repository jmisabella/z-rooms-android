Choose a place to rest for a while... (0.6s) Let your body settle... (0.8s) And softly close your eyes. (4.5s)

This meditation is a bit different. (1s)
We're going to scan the body from the feet upward… (1.2s)
Imagining energy or warmth rising through you. (3s)

But first, (0.5s) let's begin with the breath. (1.5s)
Inhale slowly (0.5s) through the nose… (0.5s)
Filling the belly first, (0.5s) then the chest… (2s)
And exhale just as slowly, (0.5s) letting everything soften. (3s)

Again… (0.5s) breathe in… (3.5s) and breathe out… (4.5s)
Slowly, (0.5s) no rush. (2s)
Breathe in (4s) and breathe out (4.5s)
In (4s) and out (5s)

Good. (0.5s) Now let the breath find its own natural rhythm. (4s)

Begin by bringing your awareness to your feet. (2s)
Notice the soles of your feet… (1.5s) your toes… (2s)
Just feeling them. (4s)

Now imagine a gentle warmth beginning there… (1.5s)
Like standing in warm sand… (1.5s)
Or sunlight touching your feet. (6s)

Let that warmth begin to rise… (1.5s)
Slowly up through your ankles… (2s)
Into your calves… (2s)
A gentle, (0.5s) comforting energy moving upward. (5s)

Feel it rise into your knees… (2.5s)
And up your thighs… (2s)
Warming… (1s) relaxing… (1s) releasing. (6s)

The energy continues to your hips… (2s)
Your lower back… (2s)
Your belly and abdomen… (2.5s)
Each area softening as the warmth passes through. (6s)

Rising into your chest now… (2s)
Your heart space… (2s)
Breathing into that warmth… (1.5s)
Letting it expand with each breath. (7s)

Feel it spread across your shoulders… (2s)
Down your arms… (2s)
To your hands… (2s)
And fingertips. (5s)

The warmth rises up your neck… (2s)
Into your jaw… (2s)
Softening your face… (2s)
Your eyes… (2s)
Your forehead… (2.5s)
All the way to the crown of your head. (6s)

Now your whole body is filled with this gentle energy… (2s)
From feet to head… (1.5s)
Completely relaxed… (1s) completely here. (12s)

Take a moment to feel your entire being… (1.5s)
Alive… (1s) warm… (1s) at peace. (15s)

Let's take three deep breaths together. (1.5s)
In… (4s) and out… (4.5s)
In… (4s) and out… (4.5s)
In… (4s) and out… (8s)

Rest in this feeling of wholeness. (14s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Wiggle your toes first… (1.5s)
Then your fingers… (1.5s)
Roll your neck gently… (2s)
Slowly opening your eyes to greet the day if you're continuing on. (2.5s)
To rest longer, (0.85s) simply stay here… (1s) letting sleep arrive naturally. (2s)

Notice how peaceful you feel. (5s)
