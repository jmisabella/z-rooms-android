Before we begin, (0.15s) from Emily Dickinson (4s)

Hope is the thing with feathers (0.8s)
That perches in the soul, (1.2s)
And sings the tune without the words, (0.8s)
And never stops at all. (6s)

Find your seat… (1s) and when ready, (0.5s) close your eyes. (4.5s)

This meditation is a bit different. (1.5s)
We're going to scan the body from the feet upward… (1.2s)
Imagining energy or warmth rising through you. (5s)

Begin by bringing your awareness to your feet. (2s)
Notice the soles of your feet… (1.5s) your toes… (2s)
Just feeling them. (4s)

Now imagine a gentle warmth beginning there… (1.5s)
Like standing in warm sand… (1.5s)
Or sunlight touching your feet. (6s)

Let that warmth begin to rise… (1.5s)
Slowly up through your ankles… (2.5s)
Into your calves… (2.5s)
A gentle, (0.3s) comforting energy moving upward. (5s)

Feel it rise into your knees… (3s)
And up your thighs… (2.5s)
Warming… (1s) relaxing… (1s) releasing. (6s)

The energy continues to your hips… (2.5s)
Your lower back… (2s)
Your belly and abdomen… (3s)
Each area softening as the warmth passes through. (6s)

Rising into your chest now… (2s)
Your heart space… (2s)
Breathing into that warmth… (1.5s)
Letting it expand with each breath. (7s)

Feel it spread across your shoulders… (2.5s)
Down your arms… (2s)
To your hands… (2s)
And fingertips. (5s)

The warmth rises up your neck… (2.5s)
Into your jaw… (2s)
Softening your face… (2s)
Your eyes… (2s)
Your forehead… (3s)
All the way to the crown of your head. (6s)

Now your whole body is filled with this gentle energy… (2s)
From feet to head… (1.5s)
Completely relaxed… (1s) completely here. (12s)

Take a moment to feel your entire being… (1.5s)
Alive… (1s) warm… (1s) at peace. (15s)

Let's take three deep breaths together. (1.5s)
In… (4s) and out… (4.5s)
In… (4s) and out… (4.5s)
In… (4s) and out… (8s)

Rest in this feeling of wholeness. (14s)

When you're ready to return… (2s)
Wiggle your toes first… (1.5s)
Then your fingers… (1.5s)
Gently roll your neck… (2s)
And slowly open your eyes. (4s)

Notice how you feel. (5s)
