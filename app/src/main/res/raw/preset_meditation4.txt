# Chapter 3: Symptoms

**Day 3–4 | MSCS Goliath, Tantalus V Orbit**

## Beat 1: Return to Ship—Subtle Wrongness

Amara ran the scanner across Jordan's neural pathways for the third time in six hours. The readout hadn't changed. Brain activity nominal. No inflammation. No lesions. No detectable pathogens. Everything looked exactly as it should for someone who'd just completed a routine surface mission.

"I feel fine," Jordan said. They'd been patient through the first two scans, but a note of irritation was creeping in now. "Really. I'm good."

"Humor me." Amara adjusted the scanner's position, targeting the hippocampus and amygdala—memory centers, emotional processing. The contact had been brief, but contact with an unknown biological agent required thorough documentation. "You touched an individual who's been in unsupported hibernation for forty years. Standard protocol."

"Two seconds of contact through gloves." Jordan's smile was meant to be reassuring. It almost worked. "If I was going to show symptoms, wouldn't they have appeared by now?"

"Not necessarily." Amara saved the scan results, cross-referenced them with the baseline from eighteen hours ago. Identical. Perfect match. Too perfect? She pushed the thought away. "Incubation periods vary. Some pathogens remain dormant for days or weeks."

"So I could be a walking biohazard." Jordan laughed—light, easy. "That's comforting."

"You are under observation, not quarantine. There's a difference." Amara set the scanner aside, pulled up Jordan's vitals on the med bay terminal. Heart rate: 62 bpm. Blood pressure: 118/76. Temperature: 37.1°C. Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute. All within normal parameters.

Better than normal, actually. Jordan's baseline heart rate was usually 68. Blood pressure ran slightly higher. The improvement was marginal but measurable.

"Your vitals are excellent," Amara said carefully. "Better than your pre-mission baseline. Any unusual sensations? Headaches? Nausea? Changes in appetite or sleep patterns?"

Jordan considered. "I slept really well last night. First time since we woke from hibernation that I didn't have... you know. The weird dreams."

The weird dreams. Amara's clinical instincts prickled. "The synchronized neural activity stopped?"

"I guess? I mean, I just slept. Normal sleep. Woke up feeling clear-headed." Jordan tilted their head slightly, a small unconscious movement. "Actually, everything feels clearer. Like hibernation fog finally lifted."

That should be good news. Amara noted it in her log with a flag for follow-up. "Any intrusive thoughts? Lost time? Sensations of presence?"

"Nope. Honestly, Doc, I think whatever happened during hibernation is resolving. We're all just stressed and reading into things." Jordan stood, stretched. "How about you? Still can't taste anything?"

The question landed like a diagnosis. Amara had been avoiding food since the mess hall incident twenty-four hours ago. The protein bar she'd forced down this morning had tasted like battery acid and rust. Her stomach had rejected it within minutes.

"Temporary dysgeusia," she said, using the clinical term as armor. "Should resolve within forty-eight hours."

"Should," Jordan repeated gently. "But it hasn't yet."

"These things take time." Amara turned back to her terminal, ending the examination through body language. "You're cleared for duty. Continue standard watch rotation. Report any changes immediately."

"Will do." Jordan paused at the med bay door. "You should eat something, though. Even if it tastes awful. Your body needs—"

"I am monitoring my own nutritional intake. Thank you, Jordan."

The door sealed behind them. Amara sat alone in the med bay's harsh white light, surrounded by equipment that insisted everyone was fine, listening to her stomach growl with a hunger she couldn't satisfy.

She pulled up Jordan's scans again. Studied the neural patterns. Compared them to the HERMES logs from hibernation—the synchronized brain activity, the impossible coherence across five separate pods.

Jordan's current scans showed no trace of that synchronization. No anomalies at all.

Either the condition had resolved completely, or it had progressed beyond her ability to detect.

Amara didn't know which possibility frightened her more.

---

Volkov found the first problem six hours after the landing party returned. Coolant pressure in the port-side circulation loop was reading three percent below nominal. Not dangerous. Not yet. But trending downward in a way that suggested slow leak rather than sensor drift.

He pulled up the diagnostic history. Yesterday: nominal. Twelve hours ago: nominal. Six hours ago: 98 percent. Now: 97 percent.

Consistent degradation. Predictable. Fixable.

He grabbed his toolkit and headed for the engineering bay's coolant access, already running through repair procedures in his head. Standard maintenance. He'd done this particular fix maybe fifty times over his career. Thirty-minute job, tops.

The access panel came off easily. The coolant coupling sat exactly where the schematic said it would—port side, third junction, behind the plasma relay. He could see it. Could reach it. Simple.

He extended his hand with the calibration tool.

Missed by seven centimeters.

"Blyat." He tried again, slower, concentrating on the physical relationship between his eyes and hands. The distance that used to be automatic now required conscious calculation. Four centimeters off this time. Better. Third attempt made contact, but his grip was wrong—he nearly dropped the tool.

The repair took an hour and forty minutes. When he finally sealed the panel and ran diagnostics, the coolant pressure read 99 percent. Within acceptable parameters. Mission accomplished.

He sat on the deck plating, hands shaking slightly, and tried not to think about how a simple repair had felt like performing surgery with his eyes closed.

This used to be easy. Everything used to be easy.

The engineering bay door hissed open. "Volkov, you down here?"

Jordan's voice. Volkov stood quickly, wiping his hands on his coveralls. "Da. Just finished coolant repair. All good."

"Nice." Jordan stepped into the bay, moving with that easy confidence pilots had in any mechanical space. They stopped by the diagnostic terminal, glanced at the readouts. "Huh. You fixed that fast."

"Just routine maintenance." Volkov busied himself with putting tools away, avoiding eye contact. He didn't want anyone to know how long it had actually taken. Didn't want them to see him struggling with tasks that should be automatic.

"Commander wants everyone on the bridge in ten," Jordan said. "Mission assessment meeting. Figure out what we salvage, what we document, how long we stay."

"Ten minutes. I will be there."

Jordan nodded, started to leave, then paused. "Hey, Volkov?"

"Da?"

"That coupling on junction seven-B. You tightened it, right? During pre-flight checks?"

Volkov's mouth went dry. "Da. Of course. Always check couplings."

"Yeah, that's what I thought." Jordan's expression was neutral. Friendly, even. "Just seems weird it would loosen after we've been stationary in orbit. Like something worked it open from the inside."

The implication sat between them, heavy and unspoken.

"Vibration from the lander launch," Volkov said. "Sometimes causes micro-adjustments in coupling tension. Not unusual."

"Right. Vibration." Jordan smiled. "Makes sense. See you at the briefing."

They left. The door sealed.

Volkov stood in the engineering bay, surrounded by tools and diagnostic equipment, and thought about Jordan's question. About the timing. About the way a perfectly functional coupling had spontaneously developed a leak exactly when it would create a minor crisis. Nothing life-threatening. Nothing that would trigger abort protocols. Just enough to require repair time. Just enough to keep them here a little longer.

Coincidence. Had to be coincidence.

But fifteen years of engineering experience was screaming at him that systems didn't fail randomly. They failed for reasons. Stress. Wear. Damage.

Or sabotage.

## Beat 2: The Briefing—Behavioral Tells Emerge

The bridge felt smaller with all five crew members present. Chen stood at the command station, mission parameters displayed on the central screen. Volkov leaned against the engineering console, arms crossed. Amara had her medical tablet out, half-attention on the briefing and half on whatever data she was reviewing. Reeves stood by the salvage assessment terminal, stylus tapping against his lips in unconscious rhythm.

And Jordan sat at the navigation console, relaxed and attentive, positioned slightly closer to Reeves than necessary.

Chen noticed. Filed it away. Continued the briefing.

"Surface assessment is complete. Colony infrastructure is intact but contaminated—biologically, psychologically, or both. Unclear. Hibernation pods contain forty-three living colonists sustained by unknown means. Salvage value: minimal for physical infrastructure, significant if we can document the hibernation technology."

"Define 'significant,'" Reeves said.

"Corporate puts indefinite-hibernation tech at fifteen to twenty million in licensing fees. If we can extract functional data, bonus payment would clear all our contracts and then some."

Volkov straightened. "That much?"

"Assuming we survive to collect," Amara muttered.

Chen ignored the comment. "However, quarantine protocols require we maintain orbit for minimum seventy-two hours post-contact before departure. Company policy. Non-negotiable."

"We've been in orbit eighteen hours," Jordan said. "Fifty-four to go. Then we leave."

"If nothing else goes wrong," Amara added.

"Why would something go wrong?" Jordan's tone was genuinely curious. Not defensive. Just... interested in the logic chain.

"Because we made direct contact with an unknown biological agent," Amara said. "Because forty-three people have been alive in unsupported hibernation for forty years through means we don't understand. Because the colony logs suggest psychological contamination leading to collective behavior patterns. Take your pick."

"Psychological contamination isn't contagious," Reeves said. "It's environmental. Remove the environment, remove the effect."

"Unless the environment is already inside us." Amara's voice was flat. "We all experienced synchronized neural activity during hibernation. While we were approaching this planet. That suggests the contamination vector is non-contact. Possibly atmospheric. Possibly—" She stopped. Seemed to reconsider. "Possibly telepathic."

The word landed in the middle of the bridge like dropped cargo.

"Telepathic," Reeves repeated. "You're proposing science fiction."

"I'm proposing we don't understand the mechanism." Amara pulled up data on her tablet, transferred it to the central display. Neural scan results. Jordan's specifically. "These are Jordan's baseline scans from yesterday. Perfect neural health. No anomalies. No sign of the synchronization patterns from hibernation."

"That's good, right?" Jordan said. "Means I'm fine."

"Or it means the infection has progressed beyond detectable parameters." Amara looked at Chen. "Commander, I recommend extended quarantine. Minimum one week orbital observation before we even consider departure."

"One week?" Volkov shook his head. "We burn through fuel and supplies for one week, we have no margin for return journey. We would need to slingshot through Tantalus IV gravity well, extend return time by three weeks."

"Better slow return than no return," Amara said.

"We don't have evidence of active infection," Chen said. "We have anomalies. We have unknowns. But quarantine protocols are clear: seventy-two hours post-contact with no symptoms equals clearance. We follow protocol."

"The protocol was written before people could survive forty years in hibernation pods," Amara said. "The protocol was written before neural synchronization across isolated systems. The protocol doesn't account for what we found down there."

"The protocol is what we have." Chen kept her voice level. Command voice. The one that didn't invite argument. "Seventy-two hours. We monitor. We document. If symptoms emerge, we extend quarantine. Otherwise, we depart on schedule."

Amara opened her mouth. Closed it. Nodded once, sharp and dissatisfied.

"Good. Reeves, continue salvage documentation. Remote observation only—no one else goes planetside. Volkov, maintain ship systems. I want full diagnostics every six hours. Osei, medical monitoring continues. Everyone reports symptoms immediately, no matter how minor. We stay alert. We stay cautious. Fifty-four hours and we're clear."

"Aye, Commander," four voices, nearly synchronized.

Jordan's came a half-second early.

Chen's eyes cut to them. Jordan blinked, as if noticing for the first time. "Sorry, jumped the gun. Bad habit from simulator training."

Plausible. Normal. Except Jordan had never done that before.

The briefing continued. Reeves outlined salvage priorities. Volkov reported on ship systems—all nominal, minor coolant issue now resolved. Amara detailed medical protocols. Everything professional. Everything routine.

But Chen was watching Jordan. Watching the way they tilted their head when Reeves spoke—same angle, same timing. Watching the way their eyes tracked Amara's movements with unusual focus. Watching the way they sat, relaxed and present in a way that felt wrong given the circumstances.

They should be worried. They'd made direct contact with an unknown biological agent. They'd touched a living person who should be dead. They should be anxious, questioning, careful.

Instead they looked content. Almost peaceful.

Like someone who'd found something they'd been missing and didn't know it until now.

---

## Beat 3: Proximity-Seeking and UV Avoidance

The mess hall at 0200 hours was usually empty. Chen had learned that in her years of salvage work—if you wanted solitude, you took it during the dead hours between watch shifts when everyone else was sleeping.

She sat at the bolted-down table, nursing bitter coffee from the synthesizer, reviewing mission logs on her tablet. Trying not to think about the photo in her quarters. The boy whose face meant nothing. The son she should love and couldn't feel.

Footsteps in the corridor. Soft. Careful.

Chen looked up as Jordan appeared in the doorway. They stopped when they saw her. "Oh. Hey, Commander. Couldn't sleep either?"

"Early watch prep." Chen gestured to the coffee maker. "Help yourself."

"Thanks." Jordan moved to the synthesizer, but instead of heading for the far seat—the usual configuration, leaving appropriate social distance—they sat down directly across from Chen. Close. Within comfortable conversation range.

Too close for the hour and situation.

Chen studied them over her coffee. "You should be resting. Medical monitoring requires full sleep cycles."

"I know. I just..." Jordan smiled, a little sheepish. "It's weird. I'm not tired. I feel really good, actually. Awake. Clear-headed. Haven't felt this good since before we left Ganymede."

The improvement should be reassuring. It wasn't. "Amara said your vitals are better than baseline."

"Yeah. Weird, right?" Jordan took a sip of their coffee, made a face. "Still tastes like recycled water, though. Some things don't change."

At least Jordan could still taste. Amara had lost three more kilograms. Chen had watched her force down a protein bar yesterday and seen the nausea hit immediately. The med bay was starting to smell like vomit no matter how much Amara cleaned.

"Can I ask you something?" Jordan said.

"Go ahead."

"Do you..." Jordan hesitated. "Do you ever feel like you're not alone? Like, even when you're by yourself, there's this sense of... presence?"

Chen's hands tightened on her coffee mug. "Elaborate."

"It's not bad," Jordan said quickly. "Not creepy or anything. Just like... background awareness? Like how you know someone's in the room even if you're not looking at them. Except it's there all the time now." They laughed, self-conscious. "I know how that sounds. Post-contact paranoia, right?"

"Possibly." Chen set her mug down with careful precision. "I'll add it to the medical log. Amara should run additional scans."

"It's really not a problem. If anything, it's kind of nice. Less lonely, you know?" Jordan's expression was open, guileless. "I spent six months in hibernation and woke up feeling like I'd forgotten how to be around people. But now it's like I never left. Like I'm more connected than before."

Connected. The word choice made Chen's skin crawl.

"Still should be documented," Chen said. She stood, gathering her tablet. "Get some rest, Jordan. That's an order."

"Aye, Commander." Jordan smiled—warm, genuine, exactly the smile they'd always had.

Chen left the mess hall and made it six steps down the corridor before stopping. Something wasn't right. Something about the conversation had felt off in a way she couldn't articulate.

She turned back. Through the mesh-reinforced window in the mess hall door, she could see Jordan still sitting at the table. Their coffee sat untouched and cooling. They weren't looking at anything in particular. Just sitting. Content.

Like they were waiting for something. Or listening to something no one else could hear.

Chen made a note in her personal log. *Jordan: proximity-seeking behavior, extended social interaction outside normal patterns, reports sensations of "presence" and "connection." Recommend continued observation.*

She continued toward the bridge, fighting the urge to look over her shoulder. Fighting the sensation—irrational, paranoid—that she was being watched even though the corridor was empty.

---

Reeves noticed it during the salvage documentation review. Day three, 1400 hours, and Jordan had volunteered to help with the remote survey data—analyzing surface scans, cataloging structural integrity, calculating extraction parameters.

Good work. Thorough work. Faster than Reeves expected from someone with pilot training rather than salvage specialization.

"You've got an eye for this," Reeves said, reviewing Jordan's assessment of the colony's solar array. "These yield calculations are more accurate than my initial estimates."

"Thanks." Jordan didn't look up from their terminal. "It just makes sense, you know? Like I can see the pattern in the data. Easier than it used to be."

Pattern recognition was good for salvage work. Essential, even. But Jordan's improvement was dramatic. Twenty-four hours ago they'd been struggling with post-hibernation fog. Now they were outperforming someone with eight years of specialized training.

"Let's check the communication array," Reeves said, pulling up the next dataset. The analysis required cross-referencing surface telemetry with pre-collapse colony logs. Complex work. Usually took him thirty minutes.

Jordan had it done in twelve.

"Jordan," Reeves said carefully. "Are you feeling alright?"

"Great, actually. Why?"

"Your cognitive performance has improved significantly since the surface mission. That's..." He chose his words with academic precision. "That's not typical post-contact behavior."

Jordan finally looked up. Their smile was easy, unbothered. "Maybe I'm just a fast learner."

"Or maybe you should report this to Amara. Cognitive enhancement is a symptom worth documenting."

"Enhancement isn't a symptom. It's an improvement." Jordan turned back to their work. "Anyway, I did report it. She ran scans yesterday. Everything came back normal."

Normal. That word again. Reeves studied Jordan's profile—the relaxed posture, the efficient movements, the complete lack of concern about their situation. They'd made direct contact with an unknown biological agent and now they were working better, sleeping better, feeling better.

That wasn't how contamination worked. That wasn't how anything worked.

"I need to cross-reference these calculations," Reeves said. "Can you route the data through the main terminal in the cargo bay?"

"Sure." Jordan stood, stretched. "Want me to bring it to you here?"

"No, I'll come down. Need to check the physical salvage inventory anyway."

They walked together from the bridge toward the cargo bay. The route took them through the central hub—the intersection where UV sterilization fields crossed the main corridor. Eight meters of purple-blue light, high-pitched whine when active, standard anti-contamination protocol for high-traffic zones.

Jordan slowed as they approached. Subtle. Barely noticeable. But their path shifted—not toward the UV corridor, but angling toward the secondary passage that ran through the cargo racks.

"UV field's down that way," Reeves said, nodding toward the direct route.

"Right, but the cargo route's faster if you're heading to the bay anyway," Jordan said. Their tone was casual, reasonable. "Saves us doubling back."

It did save time. Marginal, but measurable.

"Fair enough," Reeves said.

They took the cargo route. Jordan's posture relaxed once they were past the central hub. Subtle. But Reeves had spent eight years cataloging subtle behavioral changes in contaminated sites.

UV avoidance. Classic infection tell. Microorganisms and viruses often showed photosensitivity—light exposure caused stress responses, pain reflexes, avoidance behavior.

If Jordan was avoiding UV fields, that suggested something in their system was reacting to the light. Something that didn't want to be damaged.

Something alive.

Reeves filed the observation in his personal log. Didn't mention it to Jordan. Academic detachment required gathering more data before drawing conclusions.

But he made a note to watch Jordan's routes over the next twenty-four hours. To see if the UV avoidance was consistent or coincidental.

To see if the infection was spreading, or if he was just seeing patterns where none existed.

Either way, he'd know soon enough.

---

## Beat 4: Found Footage Reveals "Breakthrough"

Amara couldn't sleep. Couldn't eat. Couldn't focus on anything except the growing certainty that something was profoundly wrong and no one else seemed to notice.

Or maybe they noticed and didn't care. Maybe that was worse.

She sat in the med bay at 0400 hours, reviewing the colony footage they'd extracted from the underground facility's terminal. Reeves had compiled it into a timeline—early days through final transmission. Scientific documentation of how a functional colony descended into whatever they'd found in those hibernation pods.

She queued up Day 120 again. Watched it for the fifth time.

The colonists sat in a loose circle in their common area, discussing research findings. A woman with short dark hair—colony lead, according to the manifest—spoke with academic enthusiasm:

"The signal patterns are consistent. Non-random. We've ruled out geological phenomena, atmospheric interference, equipment malfunction. The source is biological, but the complexity suggests intelligence. Possibly even communication."

Another colonist leaned forward. "We should establish contact protocols. Standard first-contact procedures."

"Already started," the lead said. "We've been documenting our own neural patterns during REM sleep. Establishing baseline for comparison with the signal. If we can sync our consciousness to the frequency, we might be able to—"

The footage skipped. Corruption in the file. Amara fast-forwarded to Day 167.

Same colonists, same common area. But the atmosphere had changed. They sat closer together. Touched more frequently—shoulders, hands, foreheads pressed together in ways that felt too intimate for professional colleagues.

"The dreams are getting clearer," one man said. His eyes were bright, feverish. "Last night I saw through Martinez's perspective. Not imagination—actual perception. I experienced her childhood memory of her sister's birthday."

Martinez—the woman from the earlier footage—smiled. "I remember you being there. It felt natural. Like you'd always been part of it."

"Confirmation bias," another colonist said, but their tone was uncertain. "We're constructing false memories based on shared discussion of—"

"No," Martinez said firmly. "This is real. We're experiencing genuine cognitive connection. The signal isn't just communication—it's invitation. It's showing us how to..." She paused, searching for words. "How to remember what we were before we separated into individuals."

Amara paused the footage. *Remember what we were before we separated into individuals.* The phrasing made her medical training scream. That wasn't how consciousness worked. Human beings didn't start as a collective. They developed individual identity through neural differentiation, social learning, psychological development.

Unless Martinez wasn't talking about human development. Unless she was talking about something else. Something older.

Amara jumped to Day 380. The footage quality had degraded—camera angle slightly wrong, focus drifting. Behind the technical decline, the colonists had changed. They moved in synchronized patterns. Spoke in overlapping cadences. When one person started a sentence, another finished it without hesitation.

"We've achieved the breakthrough," Martinez said. Except her voice had harmonics underneath—multiple voices speaking through one mouth. "Integration is accelerating. The fear is fading. We understand now. Separation was the disease. Connection is the cure."

A man touched Martinez's forehead with his own. They breathed in sync. Perfect sync. And when he pulled away, both wore the same expression—serene, content, empty.

"We'll begin the hibernation preparation tomorrow," Martinez continued. "The collective wants us preserved. Wants us ready. When they send others—and they will send others—we'll be here. We'll be waiting. We'll help them understand."

The footage cut to static.

Amara sat in the cold light of the med bay, hands shaking. She pulled up Jordan's latest neural scans. Studied them with the desperate focus of someone looking for evidence to confirm or deny growing dread.

The scans showed nothing. Perfect neural health. No abnormalities. No sign of external influence.

But Martinez had looked healthy too. Right up until multiple voices started speaking through her mouth.

The med bay door hissed open. Amara jumped, hand going instinctively to the scalpel on her instrument tray.

"Easy, Doc. Just me." Jordan stepped inside, hands visible, posture non-threatening. "Saw your light on. Figured you were pulling another all-nighter."

"I'm reviewing colony medical data," Amara said. Her voice came out sharper than intended. "Medical analysis. Nothing that requires pilot input."

"Right." Jordan didn't leave. They moved closer—not threatening, just present. Standing in comfortable social distance that felt too close given the hour and circumstances. "Have you eaten today?"

"I'm monitoring my own nutritional intake."

"That's not an answer." Jordan's expression was genuinely concerned. "Amara, you're a medic. You know what three days without food does to cognition. You need to—"

"I am fine." Amara stood, putting the desk between them. "I appreciate your concern, but I'm managing. You should return to quarters. Medical monitoring requires—"

"I know what medical monitoring requires." Jordan's tone was gentle. Patient. "I'm trying to help, Doc. You've been taking care of all of us. Someone should take care of you."

The kindness was worse than confrontation would have been. Amara felt her clinical detachment crack. "I can't eat. Alright? I've tried. Everything tastes like rust and battery acid. My body rejects it within minutes. I'm down five kilograms and if this continues another three days I'll need IV nutrition, which we're not equipped for on a salvage vessel. So no, I haven't eaten today. And I won't tomorrow either. Is that what you wanted to hear?"

Jordan's concern didn't waver. "There might be another option."

"Medical options are limited by available—"

"Not medical. Just... different." Jordan moved closer. "You said everything tastes wrong. Like your body's rejecting normal food. Maybe that's not damage. Maybe that's change. Maybe your body wants something else now."

The words landed like diagnosis. Like accusation. Amara backed up until the desk edge pressed against her spine. "What are you suggesting?"

"I'm suggesting maybe the hunger you're feeling isn't for food."

The med bay air felt suddenly thick, hard to breathe. Amara's hand found the scalpel. Not threatening. Just present. "You should leave."

Jordan's expression didn't change—still kind, still concerned, still fundamentally wrong in ways Amara couldn't articulate. "I'm trying to help. We're crew. We take care of each other. You've been alone too long, Doc. Don't you feel it? The loneliness? Wouldn't it be easier to—"

"Get out."

Jordan stopped. Blinked. And for just a moment, Amara saw something flicker behind their eyes—confusion, maybe, or awareness returning like someone waking from a dream.

"Sorry," Jordan said. Their voice had lost the too-gentle quality. Sounded more like themselves. "I... I'm not sure why I said that. That was weird. I'll—I'll let you work."

They left. The door sealed.

Amara stood alone in the med bay, scalpel still in hand, heart racing, and thought about Martinez's words from the footage.

*The collective wants us preserved. Wants us ready. When they send others, we'll be waiting. We'll help them understand.*

They'd sent others.

And now Jordan was trying to help Amara understand.

She pulled up her personal log, voice shaking as she recorded: "Day three, 0430 hours. Subject Jordan Hayes exhibiting anomalous behavioral patterns. Proximity-seeking. Inappropriate social boundary crossing. Vocabulary inconsistent with baseline personality profile. Possible psychological contamination. Recommend—"

She stopped. Recommend what? Quarantine? Based on what evidence? Unusual word choice? Standing too close?

The scans showed nothing. The blood work showed nothing. By every measurable parameter, Jordan was healthy. Improving, even.

Maybe Amara was the one losing her grip. Maybe starvation was causing paranoia. Maybe she was seeing contamination where there was only stress and fatigue.

Or maybe the infection was already too deep to detect.

And maybe Jordan's too-kind expression and too-patient voice and too-close presence were the first signs that the collective had found a new vector.

Amara deleted the log entry. Replaced it with clinical observations. Factual. Unemotional. Nothing that would trigger abort protocols based on her increasingly unreliable judgment.

She would watch. She would document. She would maintain scientific objectivity.

But she would also start keeping a scalpel within reach.

Just in case.

## Beat 5: Pilot Manipulates with "Corporate Value" Angle

The bridge at 1600 hours should have been routine. Chen reviewing departure calculations, Reeves compiling salvage reports, Volkov monitoring ship systems. Professional. Efficient. Normal.

Jordan leaned over the navigation console, pulling up trajectory data. "Commander, I've been thinking about our exit window."

"Speak," Chen said.

"We're scheduled to depart in thirty-six hours. Standard quarantine clearance. But I've been reviewing the surface data—specifically the hibernation technology. If we could just document the power systems, understand the nutrient delivery mechanism, that's potentially worth millions to corporate. Not just in salvage fees, but in licensing. Patent rights."

"We've already documented the facility," Chen said.

"Remote scans, yeah. But not detailed analysis. Not enough for patent filing. We'd need to actually go back down, extract equipment samples, run component analysis." Jordan pulled up yield projections on the main display. "Conservative estimate puts total value at fifteen million. Split five ways after corporate takes their percentage, that's over a million each. Enough to clear all our contracts. Enough to retire from salvage work entirely."

The numbers glowed on screen. Impossible to ignore. Chen had spent twelve years in salvage work accumulating debt and obligations. One million would clear Liam's tuition through university. Would fund Elena's medical treatments for the next decade. Would let Chen retire planetside and actually be present for her son's adolescence.

If they survived to collect.

"Corporate wants us gone as soon as quarantine clears," Chen said. "Priority is crew safety, not salvage yields."

"But if we extended just forty-eight hours—" Jordan caught Chen's expression, moderated their tone. "I'm not suggesting we take unnecessary risks. Just a single additional surface mission. Quick extraction. Focused on the hibernation pod tech. We'd be heroes. The crew that cracked indefinite-life-support technology. That's legacy, Commander. That's—"

"That's exposure to unknown contamination vectors," Amara's voice cut through the pitch. She stood in the bridge doorway, medical tablet in hand, looking exhausted and brittle. "Forty-eight more hours in orbit means forty-eight more hours for whatever affected the colonists to affect us."

"The colonists spent eighteen months here," Jordan said. Their tone was reasonable, patient. "We've been in orbit seventy-two hours. Whatever happened to them took time. We'd be gone long before—"

"You don't know that." Amara moved to the medical station, pulled up Jordan's latest scans. "You don't know the exposure timeline. You don't know the mechanism of contamination. You're making assumptions based on inadequate data."

"So are you," Jordan said. Still reasonable. Still calm. "You're assuming contamination despite zero medical evidence. The scans are clean. The bloodwork is clean. By every measurable parameter, I'm healthier now than before surface contact."

"Healthier." Amara's voice dripped with clinical skepticism. "You're sleeping better, thinking clearer, working faster. That's not normal post-contact recovery. That's enhancement. And enhancement suggests active infection optimizing host performance."

The technical language made it sound academic. Detached. But Chen heard the fear underneath. Amara was watching Jordan like someone watching a terminal patient who didn't know they were dying.

"Or," Reeves interjected from the salvage station, "enhanced performance suggests successful recovery from hibernation-induced cognitive impairment. Occam's razor: simplest explanation is usually correct. Jordan's brain recovered faster than expected. Attributing that to infection requires extraordinary evidence."

"The colony logs are extraordinary evidence," Amara said. "Martinez and her team reported enhanced cognitive function before full psychological breakdown. Enhanced connection. Enhanced understanding. Enhanced everything right up until they lost individual identity entirely."

"We are not Martinez," Jordan said. And their voice had that too-patient quality again. That gentle, reasonable tone that made Chen's instincts scream. "We're crew. We're professionals. We're watching for symptoms. If anything seems wrong, we abort immediately. But right now, all you have is paranoia. And paranoia doesn't justify leaving millions on the table."

The word choice was wrong. Jordan had never cared about money. Their entire motivation for salvage work was family obligation, not profit. Suddenly invoking corporate value and patent rights felt alien. Borrowed. Like someone else's argument in Jordan's mouth.

Chen studied Jordan's face. Looked for the subtle tells—microexpressions, emotional leakage, signs of deception or coercion. Found nothing. Jordan looked earnest. Engaged. Genuinely invested in the argument.

Which somehow made it worse.

"We maintain current schedule," Chen said. "Thirty-six hours to quarantine clearance, then departure. No extensions. No additional surface missions. We take the data we have, file the reports, collect standard salvage fees."

"Commander—" Jordan started.

"Decision is made." Chen used her command voice. The one that didn't invite further discussion. "Return to your station."

Jordan's jaw tightened. Just a fraction. Just enough for Chen to see the frustration leak through before professional composure reasserted. "Aye, Commander."

They returned to the navigation console. Posture correct. Movements efficient.

But Chen had seen the flash of frustration. Had seen how quickly Jordan had suppressed it. Like someone remembering to act normal after forgetting for just a moment.

Amara was watching too. She caught Chen's eye across the bridge. Held it long enough to communicate: *You saw it too, right? I'm not imagining this?*

Chen gave the smallest nod. Acknowledgment without commitment. Yes, she'd seen. But seeing wasn't proof. Suspicion wasn't evidence. They needed more data before making accusations that would tear the crew apart.

"Volkov," Chen said. "Engineering report."

"All systems nominal, Commander. Coolant pressure stable. Power distribution balanced. No anomalies."

"Good. Continue six-hour diagnostic cycles. Reeves, salvage documentation status?"

"Ninety percent complete. Should have final reports ready six hours before scheduled departure."

"Perfect. Everyone maintain current watch rotations. We hold position, we monitor, we prepare for departure." Chen stood, projecting confidence she didn't feel. "Thirty-six hours. Then we're done here."

The crew dispersed to their stations. Professional. Efficient. Exactly as they should be.

Except Jordan paused by the engineering console on their way out. Just for a moment. Just long enough to exchange a glance with Reeves.

No words. No overt communication. Just eye contact that lasted half a second too long.

Chen filed it away. Added it to the growing list of subtle wrongness that her tactical training insisted meant something even if she couldn't prove what.

She pulled up her personal log. Started a new entry: *Day 3, 1615 hours. Subject Jordan Hayes exhibiting behavioral anomalies: atypical financial motivation, uncharacteristic risk tolerance, subtle communication with Subject Reeves outside normal professional protocols. No medical evidence of contamination. Psychological assessment inconclusive. Recommend—*

She stopped. Recommend what? That's where everything fell apart. By every objective measure, Jordan was fine. Healthy. Functional. Better than baseline.

But subjective assessment—twelve years of command experience, hundreds of crew evaluations, instinct honed through survival situations—screamed that Jordan was compromised.

Trust your training or trust the data. Chen couldn't have both.

She closed the log without finishing the entry. Rose from the command station. Headed for her quarters where a photo of her son waited. The son whose face she couldn't remember loving. The son who was becoming more abstract with every passing hour.

The loss should devastate her. Should consume her with grief and desperation.

Instead she just felt empty. Hollow. Like the emotional content had been carefully excised while leaving the facts intact.

Like someone was preparing her. Making her lighter. Making room for something else to fill the space where love used to be.

Chen locked her quarters door and pulled out her personal weapon—a service pistol from her military days, technically prohibited on civilian salvage vessels but small enough to hide in her footlocker.

She checked the charge. Full. Enough to put down a compromised crew member if it came to that.

She hoped it wouldn't come to that.

But twelve years of salvage work had taught her one lesson above all others: hope was a luxury professionals couldn't afford.

She secured the weapon in her belt holster, hidden under her jacket. Just in case.

Then she sat at her desk and tried to remember what it felt like to love her son.

Nothing.

Just empty space where family used to be. And quiet voices, getting louder, insisting the emptiness was better. Easier. That carrying the weight of individual attachment was exhausting and unnecessary and fundamentally wrong.

That letting go would feel like coming home.

Chen pushed the voices away and focused on her mission logs.

Thirty-six hours.

She could last thirty-six hours.

She had to.
