Before we begin, (0.15s) an excerpt from William Wordsworth's I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud (4s)

For oft when on my couch I lie (0.7s)
In vacant or in pensive mood, (1.4s)
They flash upon that inward eye (0.8s)
Which is the bliss of solitude, (1.5s)
And then my heart with pleasure fills, (1s)
And dances with the Daffodils. (5s)

Find a comfortable seat… (0.15s) or lie down… (1.15s) and when you're ready, (0.2s) gently close your eyes. (4.7s)

Just take a moment to notice that you've arrived here… (0.15s) a small pause just for you. (5s)

Today might have been full… (0.4s) busy… (0.3s) or quiet… (0.8s)
Whatever it was (0.5s) it's okay. (0.7s)
There's nothing to fix right now. (6s)

Let's begin with the breath. (1.7s)
Inhale slowly (0.17s) through the nose… (0.25s)
Filling the belly first, (0.5s) then the chest… (2s)
And exhale just as slowly, (0.55s) letting everything soften. (3s)

Again… (0.4s) breathe in… (3.65s) and breathe out… (4.5s)
Slowly,(0.25s) no rush. (2s)
Breathe in (4s) and breathe out (4.5s)
In (4.2s) and out (5.3s)

If the mind is replaying the day, (0.15s) that's perfectly normal. (0.7s)
Just notice it… (0.025s) like watching clouds drift across the sky… (1.5s)
No need to chase them… (0.8s)
Gently come back to the breath. (8s)

Now we'll do a few rounds of box breathing together. (1.8s)
Just follow my voice (0.4s) ready? (1s)
Inhale for four… (0.05s)
One (1.0s)
Two (1.15s)
Three (1.2s)
Four (2s)

Hold (0.1s)
One (0.9s)
Two (1.15s)
Three (1.15s)
Four (2s)

Exhale (0.12s)
One (0.9s)
Two (1.15s)
Three (1.15s)
Four (2s)

And hold it empty, (0.07s)
Three (1s)
Four (2s)

Again. (0.4s)
In… (0.9s)
Two… (1.15s)
Three… (1.15s)
Four… (2.15s)

Hold… (1s)
Two… (1.1s)
Three… (1.1s)
Four… (2s)

Out… (0.9s)
Two… (1.1s)
Three… (1.1s)
Four… (2s)

Empty… (0.7s)
Two… (1s)
Three… (1.1s)
Four… (5s)

Good. (0.45s) Now let the breath find its own natural rhythm. (0.5s)
Observe each breath. (12s)

Let's gently scan the body, (0.16s) starting at the top of the head… (2s)
Noticing any tension in the scalp… (2.4s)
The forehead… (2.4s)
Let it melt… (2s)
The eyes soft… (2.5s)
Jaw unclenched… (3s)
Shoulders drop away from the ears… (2s)
Arms heavy… (2s)
Hands resting… (3s)
Chest open… (2.5s)
Belly soft… (3s)
Legs heavy… (2.5s)
Feet grounded. (8s)

Wherever you notice tightness, (0.4s) breathe into it… (0.15s)
And on the out-breath, (0.1s) let it go. (10s)

Your only job right now is to rest here… (0.4s) nothing to do… (0.6s) nowhere to go. (12s)

The day can wait a little longer. (1.8s) You've given yourself this gift. (16s)

And when you're ready… (2.4s)
Bring a little movement to the fingers and toes… (2s)
Take a deeper breath… (0.7s)
And gently open your eyes. (4s)
