# PRELUDE

You sign the contract because you need to eat. Because the rent on your compartment in the Ganymede hab-ring is three weeks overdue. Because your daughter needs new pressure seals for her school suit, or your sister needs surgery, or your parents want to move back to Earth before they die. The reasons vary. The outcome does not.

The contract is forty-seven pages of legal text optimized for corporate liability protection. You scroll through terms like "acceptable casualty rates" and "postmortem contractor obligations" and "next-of-kin waiver clauses." The death rate for salvage crews hovers between fifteen and twenty percent. The pay is mediocre. The jobs are scarce. You sign anyway.

Someone has to pick through the ruins.

The colonies fail more often than the recruitment ads suggest. Atmospheric processors malfunction. Reactor shielding degrades. Pathogens evolve. Supply chains collapse. People go silent. Six months later, or six years, or sixty, a salvage contract gets posted on the job boards. Benson-class vessels depart Ganymede or Ceres or Titan, skeleton crews strapped into hibernation pods, heading toward places where people used to be.

You do not think of yourself as a scavenger. The company prefers the term "recovery specialist" or "reclamation technician." The contracts call you an "independent corporate contractor." You call yourself employed.

The work is simple in theory. Travel to the dead colony. Assess structural integrity. Document salvageable equipment. File reports. Extract anything worth the cargo space. Avoid thinking too hard about the personal effects you find in the habitation modules—the photos, the children's drawings, the half-written messages that end mid-sentence.

Most colonies die quietly. Equipment failure. Supply shortage. Slow economic strangulation. Bodies in beds, or empty corridors, or careful graves outside the airlocks. Clean deaths, in the catalog language. Quick reports. Acceptable salvage yields.

Some colonies are harder to categorize.

---

Tantalus V went silent forty years ago. The colony was eighteen months old—past the high-mortality initialization phase, well into stable operations. One hundred forty-seven colonists. Mining operation, modest but profitable. Then nothing. No distress call. No evacuation beacon. Just silence.

The company wrote it off. Forty years passed.

Six months ago, the distress beacon reactivated.

No explanation. No follow-up communication. Just the automated signal, pulsing through the void with the regularity of a heartbeat. The company ran cost-benefit analyses. Crew availability assessments. Insurance risk calculations. Three weeks ago, the salvage contract was posted.

The MSCS *Goliath* is a Benson-class salvage vessel, one hundred twenty meters of reinforced hull and cargo space. Crew capacity rated for five to eight. Current complement: five. Minimal configuration. The ship launched from Ganymede six standard months ago—one hundred eighty-six days of sublight transit, most of it spent in hibernation while the ship's ion drives burn through the dark.

Commander Lian Chen, forty-four. Former military, now corporate crew lead. She needs the money for her son's education, for her partner's medical expenses. She has the command experience to keep four people alive in a hostile environment. She has led crews before. Most of them survived.

Dmitri Volkov, thirty-eight. Ship engineer. He is paying off his sister's debts to avoid her entering the same contracts he is trapped in. He can fix anything with moving parts and most things without. Fifteen years' experience. The ship will function. Probably.

Dr. Amara Osei, thirty-two. Medic and biologist. Student loans and family obligations. She chose salvage over research because field work pays better and the job market for xenobiology PhDs remains catastrophically oversaturated. She will keep the crew healthy. That is the theory.

Jordan Kim, twenty-seven. Pilot. Saves to relocate parents from the Martian arcologies to Earth before the atmospheric stabilization fails. Young, optimistic, competent. The ship will reach its destination. The landing will be clean.

Dr. Marcus Reeves, thirty-five. Salvage assessment specialist. Gambling debts, primarily. He has the academic training to appraise what they find, the practical greed to maximize salvage yields, and the cynical awareness that none of this matters unless they survive to collect payment.

Five people. One hundred eighty-six days to Tantalus V. Forty-eight hours planetside for assessment and initial salvage. One hundred eighty-six days return to Ganymede. Payment on delivery. Penalties for early abort: eighteen months' salary per contractor.

The *Goliath*'s med bay contains five hibernation pods. Life support reduces to minimal power. Neural monitors track brain activity. Medical systems maintain homeostasis. You sleep through the dark. Six months compressed to unconscious void.

The pods seal with a hiss like an apology.

The ship burns outward, trailing fusion fire, a pinprick of light swallowed by the vast and patient dark.
