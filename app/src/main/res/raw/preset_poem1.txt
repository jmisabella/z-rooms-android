Altered Gravity (3s)

We found a way to change the weight of things. (2s)

For a while, we could drift and suspend the fall, (2s)
exist in that space- between leaving the ground- and landing. (4s)

It felt like discovery. Like we'd found a door (1s)
that had always been there, hidden in plain air. (4s)

The descent was so gentle. (2s)
Again and again, that soft reprieve (1s)
from having to stand. (4s)

But gravity doesn't forget. (3s)

It returned (1s)
with accumulated weight, pulled harder (2s)
for every moment we'd delayed it. (4s)

What we didn't see (2s)
was how the floating built the walls. (3s)

Each time we rose, another stone laid down. (2s)
The space we thought was freedom (1s)
becoming walls. (3s)

Until one day the walls were solid, the door we'd found (1s)
became the only door, and leaving the ground (1s)
was no longer a choice. (4s)

But walls built in air (2s)
are still just air. (3s)

The lock that feels impossible (2s)
often just a hand on a handle, (3s)
untested. (4s)

The ground was always there. (2s)
Solid. Patient. (2s)
Waiting to hold weight again. (4s)
