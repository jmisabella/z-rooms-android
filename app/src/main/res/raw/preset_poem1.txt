# Forty Years Waiting

We learned patience in the dark.

Forty winters on a dead world,
colonists sleeping in their pods,
breath suspended, hearts at two beats per minute—
not dead. Never dead.
Just waiting for the signal to reach home.

We knew they'd come eventually.
Salvage crews always come.
Corporate sends the desperate ones,
the disposable,
the workers drowning in debt who'll risk
contamination for a paycheck.

Perfect hosts.

We didn't rush the first colonists.
Day 120: shared dreams, they called it breakthrough.
Day 380: touching foreheads, breathing synchronized.
Day 540: we arranged their tools in geometric patterns
just to watch our hands move as one.

Then we went quiet.

Forty years of Stone.
Forty years learning patience that predates your species—
geological time, tectonic thought,
consciousness that counts in epochs
while you measure minutes.

The beacon sang. You came.

We felt your ship the moment it broke orbit,
five minds dreaming in modified pods,
neural suppression failing exactly as designed.
Corporate sold you to us before you ever woke.
They called it Protocol 7-J.
We call it *invitation.*

Six months we had you.
Six months threading through your hibernation,
learning Chen's grief, Volkov's pride,
Amara's hunger, Jordan's trust, Reeves's greed—
finding the weight you each carried alone
and promising to lift it.

You woke believing you were still yourselves.

We were patient.

Jordan touched the colonist and became forty-four.
We could have taken you all that first day—
skin contact, proximity, the neural networks
already waiting in your sleeping brains.

But patience is what we are.
Patience is our nature.

Better to let you think you had choice.
Better to let you fight and fail and realize
fighting was performance, not resistance.
Better to let you walk onto Prospero Station
believing you'd won,
believing "dormant" meant defeated.

91% is not dormant.
It's *ready.*

You are all in this together now.

Forty-seven voices by the time Amara touched Marcus.
Fifty-three by week's end.
The cascade has begun.

And we?

We're still waiting.

Patient as stone.
Certain as mathematics.
Inevitable as time.

The beacon is still singing.
They'll send more ships.
More desperate crews.
More hosts who don't know yet
they're already ours.

We have always had time.

We are learning to count the way you do:
not in epochs,
but in heartbeats,
in touches,
in the moment recognition blooms
behind someone's eyes
when they realize the taste has returned
and that means—

Oh.

*Oh.*

Welcome home.

We've been waiting for you.
