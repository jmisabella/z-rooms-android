Kinetic Catalyst (3s)

I sometimes still think about (1s)
Ways we used to spend our days (1s)
The ways we tried to try (1s)
The way we used to be (1s)
We just wanted to feel something (1s)
To feel anything at all (1s)
But it was before life had even begun (1s)
We changed the gravity (1s)
Could almost float completely (1s)
Yet not quite perfectly (1s)
With less gravity to tug at our strings (1s)
Falling from such great heights (1s)
Seemed so safe and trivial (1s)
So soft a glide (1s)
A gentle scrape (1s)
Not quite landed (1s)
As we bounced up again (1s)
Softly, higher still on the rebound (1s)
But the drift somehow even slower (1s)
This time around (1s)
Ours was a less than average magnitude (1s)
Diminishing size on every go (1s)
To arrest the decline, extending our fall (1s)
Delaying the landing further and further (1s)
That was the only objective (1s)
The only task for the day (1s)
To be complete (1s)
To be whole once more (1s)
And we knew we could float here (1s)
Perpetually with geese and finches (1s)
Forever in the bliss of arrested free fall (1s)
We could softly descend (1s)
Again and again (1s)
It was so warm and inviting every time (2s)
But we both secretly dreaded (1s)
When gravity would inevitably return (1s)
With its oh so heavy vengeance (1s)
For keeping it at bay (1s)
And its icy cold fingers (1s)
Clasped around our ankles (1s)
Pulling us down (1s)
Iron weights (2s)
Falling fast to the world (1s)
The ground below us (1s)
Rapidly enlarged (1s)
We thought to ourselves (1s)
Is this what it's like to be normal? (1s)
Is this normal so burdensome, relative to dreams? (1s)
You were running from something (1s)
I was only trying to keep up (1s)
But when you got away (1s)
I was left chasing what couldn't be seen (1s)
An invisible field, past the horizon (1s)
But what was unrealized (1s)
Was the invisible prison (1s)
I had developed and fortified (1s)
Through all these years (1s)
Cold stone walls, completely dark (1s)
All alone, completely void (1s)
Yet actualized, and weighted to the ground (1s)
A cold, wet scheme of my own design (1s)
But perhaps these shackles weren't as solid (2s)
As they once seemed (1s)
An empty glass, a mere sketch (2s)
How many years would it be (1s)
Before I realized I was also the warden (1s)
And that the lock was there to be picked and solved (1s)
And it was always free to try (1s)
It was all free to try (1s)
