Altered Gravity (3s)

I sometimes still think about (1s)
Ways we used to spend our days (1s)
We just wanted to feel something (1s)
To experience anything at all (2s)
Before life had even begun (1s)
We changed the gravity (3s)

Could almost float completely (1s)
Drift down from great heights (1s)
Seemed so safe and trivial (2s)
So soft a glide (1s)
A gentle scrape (1s)
Not quite landed (3s)

Delaying the landing further and further (1s)
That was the only objective (1s)
The only task for the day (3s)

To be complete (1s)
To be whole once more (1s)
Forever in the bliss of arrested free fall (2s)
We could softly descend (1s)
Again and again (3s)

It was so warm and inviting every time (3s)

But we both secretly dreaded (1s)
When gravity would inevitably return (1s)
With its oh, so heavy vengeance (3s)

Icy cold fingers (1s)
Clasped around our ankles (1s)
Pulling us down (1s)
Iron weights (3s)

The ground below us (1s)
Rapidly enlarged (3s)

Is this what it's like to be normal? (2s)
You were running from something (1s)
I was only trying to keep up (3s)

But when you got away (2s)
I was left chasing what couldn't be seen (1s)
An invisible field, past the horizon (3s)

What was unrealized (2s)
Was the invisible prison (1s)
I had developed and fortified (1s)
Through all these years (3s)

Cold stone walls, completely dark (1s)
All alone, completely void (3s)

Yet actualized, weighted to the ground (1s)
A cold, wet scheme of my own design (3s)

But perhaps these shackles weren't as solid (3s)

As they once seemed (1s)
An empty glass, a mere sketch (3s)

How many years would it be (2s)
Before I realized I was also the warden (2s)
And that the lock was there to be picked and solved (2s)
And it was always free to try (1s)
It was all free to try (2s)
