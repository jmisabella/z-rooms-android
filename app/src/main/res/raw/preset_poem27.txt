Elsewhere (3s)

There's a door in my mind (2s)
that's always unlocked. (3s)

I don't remember installing it, (2s)
but I know exactly where it is, (2s)
and when the room I'm in (1s)
becomes too loud, (1s)
too bright, (1s)
too insistent on my presence, (3s)

I slip through. (2s)

On the other side (1s)
everything is softer. (3s)

Sounds don't demand answers. (2s)
Faces don't need explanations. (2s)
Time moves (1s)
but doesn't pull. (3s)

I can stay as long as I want. (3s)

The problem is coming back. (3s)

Because the door works both ways, (2s)
and the longer I'm gone (2s)
the stranger this place feels, (2s)
the less my body fits (1s)
the space it's supposed to fill. (4s)

People say my name (2s)
and I'm already halfway through. (3s)

One foot here, (1s)
one foot nowhere, (2s)
and the split is starting to show, (3s)

the way I answer questions (2s)
from the wrong side, (2s)
the way my eyes focus (1s)
on something just past (1s)
what everyone else is seeing. (4s)

I know I should close it. (2s)
I know I should stay. (3s)

But the door is always there, (2s)
always open, (2s)
and I am always, (2s)
always (1s)
so tired (2s)
of being here. (5s)
