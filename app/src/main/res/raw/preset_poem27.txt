Corrosion (3s)

It starts so small you barely see it (2s)
a tiny spot of orange-brown (2s)
on something strong, something you believed in, (3s)
a structure you thought could not come down. (4s)

Just a fleck, a minor blemish, (2s)
easy to dismiss, to wish away, (3s)
impossible to see it spread and turn. (4s)

But rust is patient, (2s)
it works in places you don't check, (3s)
beneath the surface, slowly running (3s)
through the framework, deck by deck. (4s)

It finds the hidden joints and corners, (2s)
the places where the light doesn't reach, (3s)
feeding on what moisture offers, (3s)
expanding its corrosive reach. (4s)

You notice more spots appearing (2s)
in places that seemed solid, sound, (3s)
the strong supports you trusted (3s)
now fragile, weakened, breaking down. (4s)

It spreads to places you thought sacred, (2s)
infiltrates what you held dear, (3s)
even in the structures you most valued (3s)
the rust finds pathways to appear. (4s)

The buildings that were meant to shelter, (3s)
the frameworks built to keep us safe, (3s)
all vulnerable to this quiet hunter. (5s)
