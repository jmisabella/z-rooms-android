The Rust (3s)

It starts so small you barely see it (1s)
a tiny spot of orange brown (1s)
on something strong, something you believed in, (1s)
a structure you thought could not come down. (3s)

Just a fleck, a minor blemish, (1s)
nothing worth your deep concern, (1s)
easy to dismiss, to wish away, (1s)
impossible to see it spread and turn. (3s)

But rust is patient, rust is cunning, (1s)
it works in places you don't check, (1s)
beneath the surface, slowly running (1s)
through the framework, deck by deck. (3s)

It finds the hidden joints and corners, (1s)
the places where the light doesn't reach, (1s)
feeding on what moisture offers, (1s)
expanding its corrosive reach. (3s)

You notice more spots appearing, (1s)
in places that seemed solid, sound, (1s)
the strong supports you trusted (1s)
now fragile, weakened, breaking down. (3s)

It spreads to places you thought sacred, (1s)
infiltrates what you held dear, (1s)
even in the structures you most valued, (1s)
the rust finds pathways to appear. (3s)

The buildings that were meant to shelter, (1s)
the frameworks built to keep us safe, (1s)
all vulnerable to this quiet hunter, (1s)
this slow decay that leaves no trace (3s)

until the damage is extensive, (1s)
until the weakness is revealed, (1s)
until you realize the defensive (1s)
walls you built were never sealed. (3s)

But here's the thing about corrosion: (1s)
it only thrives when left alone, (1s)
when we refuse to see erosion, (1s)
when we pretend that rust won't grow. (3s)

Awareness is the first resistance, (1s)
acknowledgment the opening move, (1s)
naming what we see at distance (1s)
before it spreads too far to remove. (3s)

We can't prevent all degradation, (1s)
can't keep everything pristine, (1s)
but we can practice observation, (1s)
see the rust before it's unseen. (3s)

We can scrape away what's damaged, (1s)
reinforce what's wearing thin, (1s)
refuse to let the slow advantage (1s)
of neglect and time set in. (3s)

The rust will always be attempting (1s)
to claim what strength we've built, (1s)
but we are not defenseless, not exempting (1s)
ourselves from care, from guilt. (3s)

So look closely at your structures, (1s)
the ones you think will always stand, (1s)
check the hidden joints and junctures, (1s)
hold awareness in your hand. (3s)

The fight against corrosion (1s)
is constant, vigilant, and slow, (1s)
but recognition is the potion (1s)
that keeps the rust from taking hold. (3s)
