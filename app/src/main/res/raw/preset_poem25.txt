What the Voices Said (3s)

The woman at the checkout (2s)
judging my groceries, (2s)
the man on the bus (2s)
sick of my voice, (3s)
the mothers with their children (2s)
performing, entitled, (3s)
everything I wasn't. (4s)

Then someone I loved left, (3s)
not by choice but by the mechanics (2s)
of bodies that stop working. (5s)

Now when I see an older person working (2s)
cutting hair, scanning groceries, cleaning tables (3s)
I see tired hands that keep showing up, (3s)
someone's child trying to make it through. (4s)

And when I see a mother with a child, (3s)
I see a circle (3s)
the holding and being held, (3s)
the trying and the trying again. (4s)

I see myself in that circle now, (3s)
both positions at once. (5s)
