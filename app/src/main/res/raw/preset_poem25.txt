What I See Now (3s)

I used to hear voices everywhere (1s)
not out loud, but in my head, (1s)
translating every glance, every pause (1s)
into proof that people found me (1s)
lacking, annoying, wrong. (3s)

The woman at the checkout was judging my groceries. (1s)
The man on the bus thought I talked too much. (1s)
Mothers with their children especially (1s)
I saw entitlement, I saw performance, (1s)
I saw everything except what was actually there. (3s)

Then someone I loved left, (1s)
not by choice but by the cruel mechanics (1s)
of bodies that stop working, (1s)
and something in me broke open (1s)
in a way that wouldn't close back up. (3s)

Now when I see an older person working (1s)
cutting hair, scanning groceries, cleaning tables (1s)
I find I don't hear the criticism anymore. (1s)
I see tired hands that keep showing up, (1s)
I see someone's child trying to make it through, (1s)
I see the quiet dignity of just continuing. (3s)

And when I see a mother with a child, (1s)
I don't see what I used to see. (1s)
I see a circle— (1s)
the holding and being held, (1s)
the trying and the trying again, (1s)
the fierce ordinary love (1s)
that shapes a person into who they become. (3s)

I see myself in that circle now, (1s)
both positions at once, (1s)
and it doesn't hurt the way I thought it would. (3s)

The voices are quieter these days. (1s)
What I hear instead is my own voice saying (1s)
they're struggling too, (1s)
they're doing their best, (1s)
they're someone's person, (1s)
just like I was someone's. (3s)

Loss carved out space in me (1s)
where judgment used to live, (1s)
and empathy moved in (1s)
not the kind you perform, (1s)
but the kind that recognizes (1s)
everyone is carrying something, (1s)
everyone is someone's circle, (1s)
everyone is just trying to get through. (3s)

Wish I'd seen this sooner. (1s)
So grateful to see it now. (3s)
