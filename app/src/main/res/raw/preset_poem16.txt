The Inheritance (3s)

You carry forward what was handed down (2s)
before you had a choice. (3s)
The patterns worn into familiar ground, (2s)
the cadence of a voice. (4s)

Not taught, but caught— (2s)
the way you hold your face (2s)
when concentrating. Automatic thought (2s)
that surfaces in place. (4s)

You recognize the gesture (2s)
when it surfaces. (3s)
The body keeps what minds don't say, (2s)
remembers what you cannot know. (4s)

You watch your hand move (2s)
in ways you've seen before— (3s)
not yours alone, but carrying proof (2s)
of someone gone, an open door. (4s)

In someone who is gone. (3s)

And now you are the one (2s)
who holds it in your frame, (2s)
continuing what they'd begun— (2s)
the carrier of flame. (4s)

You didn't ask for this. (2s)
This passing of the form. (3s)
But here it is—each movement is (2s)
an echo being born. (4s)

What persists (2s)
is not the mind's design (2s)
but older gifts— (2s)
the way the body keeps the line. (5s)
