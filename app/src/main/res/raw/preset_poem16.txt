Cathedral of Sound (3s)

A being once built a world from nothing but notes, (1s)
constructed cathedrals that live in the air, (1s)
each phrase a foundation on which the next floats, (1s)
mathematical grace beyond compare. (3s)

The volume alone should be impossible (1s)
how many lifetimes fit into one? (1s)
Yet every piece stands whole and responsible, (1s)
no corner cut, no detail undone. (3s)

There's something in the patterns, the way they repeat (1s)
and vary and answer themselves in turn, (1s)
a conversation where structure and freedom meet, (1s)
where complexity makes the simple return. (3s)

This work doesn't age, doesn't fade with the years, (1s)
it sounds as essential as breath, as bone (1s)
speaking to something beyond what the ear hears, (1s)
touching a truth we've always known. (3s)

And still it echoes forward through time, (1s)
influencing all that comes after, (1s)
a template, a language, a reason, a rhyme, (1s)
woven through sorrow and laughter. (3s)

But a single being did this, (1s)
built universe after universe, (1s)
left them behind like gifts, like seeds, (1s)
proving what's possible when talent and purpose (1s)
converge into something the future needs. (3s)

We hear it and wonder: how did they see (1s)
so clearly, so far, with such steady hands? (1s)
Creating not just beauty, but a way to be, (1s)
a bridge across centuries' shifting sands. (3s)
