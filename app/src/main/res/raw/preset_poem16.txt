Cathedral of Sound (2s)

Someone once mapped the architecture of air, (1s)
built rooms that exist only when they're heard, (1s)
each chamber opening onto the next with care, (1.5s)
foundation and flight in a single word. (2.5s)

The sheer weight of it—how does one hand hold (1s)
galaxies, each one spinning complete? (1.5s)
Every world intact, none half-told, (1s)
nothing rushed, nothing incomplete. (2.5s)

Listen to how the patterns fold and rise, (1s)
repeating, transforming, answering back, (1.5s)
structure dancing with its own surprise, (1s)
freedom finding the pulse it seemed to lack. (2.5s)

This doesn't fade. It lives in the body, (1s)
permanent as gravity, as tide, (1.5s)
reaching past the mind into something we (1s)
recognize but can't name from inside. (2.5s)

Still it moves forward, shaping what comes next, (1s)
a language others learn to speak, (1.5s)
woven into grief and joy's text, (1s)
making the strong stronger, lifting the weak. (2.5s)

One life contained all this. (1.5s)
Universe after universe unfurled, (1.5s)
left behind like light, like breath, like bliss— (1.5s)
proof of what one human can give the world. (3s)

We listen now across the years and wonder (1s)
how anyone saw so far, so clear, (1.5s)
built not just beauty but the truth under, (1.5s)
a bridge that holds us, century to century, here. (3s)
