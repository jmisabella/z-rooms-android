When I Heard the Learned Astronomer (3s)
By Walt Whitman (3s)

When I heard the learned astronomer, (2s)
When the proofs, (1s)
the figures, (1s)
were ranged in columns before me, (3s)
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, (1s)
to add, (1s)
divide, (1s)
and measure them, (3s)
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture room, (2s)
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, (3s)
Till rising and gliding out I wandered off by myself, (2s)
In the mystical moist night air, (1s)
and from time to time, (3s)
Looked up in perfect silence at the stars. (3s)
