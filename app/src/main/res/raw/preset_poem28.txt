The Sunbeam (3s)

The cat has found a patch of light (1s)
on the living room floor, (1s)
a rectangle of warmth (1s)
that appeared sometime after breakfast (1s)
and belongs, clearly, to her. (3s)

She stretches into it completely, (1s)
belly up, paws curled, (1s)
occupying the brightness (1s)
with the confidence of someone (1s)
who has never questioned (1s)
her right to comfort. (3s)

An hour passes. (1s)
The sun moves. (1s)
The rectangle shifts six inches to the left. (3s)

The cat opens one eye, (1s)
assesses the situation, (1s)
and with great deliberation (1s)
rises, circles once, (1s)
and relocates precisely (1s)
to where the warmth has gone. (3s)

This happens four more times (1s)
throughout the afternoon (1s)
the sun's slow arc across the floor, (1s)
the cat's patient migration, (1s)
her commitment to staying (1s)
exactly where the light is. (3s)

She doesn't fight the movement, (1s)
doesn't wish the sun would stay, (1s)
just follows where it leads her, (1s)
trusting that the warmth (1s)
will keep appearing (1s)
if she pays attention. (3s)

By evening the sunbeam has climbed (1s)
halfway up the wall, (1s)
impossible to claim, (1s)
and the cat finally relents, (1s)
curling up in the chair (1s)
to wait for tomorrow's light. (3s)

There's something to learn here (1s)
about following warmth, (1s)
about not resisting natural movement, (1s)
about the art of relocating (1s)
when circumstances shift, (1s)
about knowing what you need (1s)
and claiming it completely (1s)
for as long as it lasts. (3s)

The cat already knows this. (1s)
She's been practicing all afternoon. (3s)
