Migration (3s)

The cat has found a patch of light (2s)
on the living room floor, (2s)
a rectangle of warmth (2s)
that appeared sometime after breakfast (3s)
and belongs, clearly, to her. (4s)

She stretches into it completely, (2s)
belly up, paws curled, (3s)
occupying the brightness. (4s)

An hour passes. (2s)
The sun moves. (2s)
The rectangle shifts six inches to the left. (4s)

The cat opens one eye, (2s)
assesses the situation, (2s)
and with great deliberation (3s)
rises, circles once, (3s)
and relocates precisely (3s)
to where the warmth has gone. (4s)

This happens four more times (2s)
throughout the afternoon (3s)
the sun's slow arc across the floor, (3s)
the cat's patient migration. (4s)

By evening the sunbeam has climbed (2s)
halfway up the wall, (3s)
impossible to claim, (3s)
and the cat finally relents, (4s)
curling up in the chair (3s)
to wait for tomorrow's light. (5s)
