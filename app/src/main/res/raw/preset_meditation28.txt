Before we begin, (0.15s) from an old Zen saying. (1.8s)

Let go, (1s) or be dragged. (6s)

Choose a place to rest for a while… (0.5s) Let your body settle… (0.8s) And softly close your eyes. (4.5s)

Let's begin with a few grounding breaths. (2s)
Inhale through your nose… (4s)
Exhale through your mouth… (5s)
In… (4s)
Out… (5s)

This is a practice of releasing worry, (1.5s) one piece at a time. (4s)

Imagine you're standing by a gentle stream. (2.5s)
The water flows by, (1s) calm and steady. (4s)

In your hands, (0.8s) you're holding smooth stones. (2s)
Each stone is a worry. (3s)

Look at the first stone. (2s)
Notice what worry it represents. (3s)
Name it quietly to yourself. (6s)

Now, (0.5s) place it in the stream. (2.5s)
Watch it sink to the bottom. (2s)
The water flows over it. (2s)
It's still there, (0.8s) but you're not holding it anymore. (5s)

Pick up the next stone. (1.5s)
Another worry. (2s)
Name it. (4s)
And release it into the stream. (3s)
Watch it settle. (5s)

One more stone. (1.5s)
Feel its weight in your hand. (2s)
This worry has been heavy. (3s)
But you can put it down. (3s)
Release it into the water. (3s)
Let the stream carry it. (6s)

Keep releasing stones, (1s) one by one. (2s)
As many as you need to. (10s)

Notice how your hands feel lighter. (3s)
How your shoulders drop. (3s)
How your chest opens. (5s)

The worries still exist. (2s)
They're in the stream. (1.5s)
But you don't have to carry them. (6s)

Stand by the stream with empty hands. (3s)
Palms open. (1.5s)
Free. (6s)

Listen to the water flowing. (10s)

You can come back to this stream anytime. (2.5s)
Anytime you need to put something down. (6s)

Rest here with empty hands. (14s)

In your own time… (2s)
Take a deep breath… (2.5s)
Gently move your body… (1.5s)
Eyes opening to the world if continuing, hands lighter now. (2s)
To sleep, (1s) stay by the stream with hands empty and free, (1s) letting sleep flow over you. (5s)
