The Choice (3s)

You worked in the same lab. (3s)
Shared the same equipment. (3s)
Ate lunch at the same table (2s)
for six years. (4s)

Then came the patient. (3s)
The child. (2s)
The experimental treatment. (4s)

One of you said yes. (3s)
One of you said no. (4s)

The treatment worked. (3s)
The child lived. (4s)

But the cost— (4s)

You see each other at conferences now. (4s)

Make eye contact across rooms. (3s)
Nod. (2s)
Don't approach. (4s)

You both know (2s)
what the other is thinking. (4s)

The one who said yes thinks: (2s)
I saved a life. (3s)
Whatever the price, (2s)
a child is alive (2s)
who wouldn't be. (4s)

The one who said no thinks: (2s)
I held the line. (3s)
Refused to normalize (2s)
what we don't understand. (4s)

Both of you are right. (4s)
Both of you are wrong. (5s)

The distance between you (2s)
isn't anger. (3s)
It's the unbridgeable gap (2s)
between two defensible choices. (5s)

You could have been the other. (4s)

On a different day, (2s)
in a different mood, (2s)
with different sleep, (3s)
you might have chosen (2s)
what they chose. (5s)

And they know it too. (4s)

That's what makes it (2s)
impossible (2s)
to stand (1s)
in the same room. (5s)

Not judgment. (3s)

Recognition. (4s)

You see in their face (3s)
the version of yourself (2s)
you refused to become. (5s)

And they see in yours (3s)
the same. (5s)
