The Rift (3s)

They studied side by side in younger days, (2s)
two students bent over the same ancient tome, (2s)
learning to shape the world in different ways, (3s)
two branches growing from a single home. (4s)

The rift began with one child, fever-bright, (2s)
one reaching for a cure too dark to speak, (2s)
one stepping back into the failing light, (2s)
a widening distance between friends. (4s)

One chose the quicker path, the sharper blade, (1s)
paid what the desperate ask without a pause, (2s)
saw mercy in the swiftness of the trade, (2s)
accepting neither mercy nor its laws. (4s)

The other walked through slower, tangled ground, (1s)
held vigil through the long and failing nights, (2s)
carried the wounds that would not come unwound, (2s)
refused the cost of too-easy light. (4s)

In quiet moments, one sees the other's face (2s)
and recognizes in those distant eyes (3s)
the same knife-edge they both once had to trace. (4s)

They stand opposed now, separated, strange, (2s)
but both remember sitting side by side, (3s)
both wondering when the turning came, the change, (3s)
both mourning something that has died. (4s)

Two students of the same old burning art, (2s)
divided by the paths their choices made, (2s)
united by the breaking of one heart. (4s)
