# Chapter 2: Descent

**Day 2 (Morning–Evening) | Tantalus V Surface & Underground Colony**

---

The lander kicked up rust-colored dust as it settled on the landing pad—if you could call it that. Chen watched through the viewport as the particles drifted in strange, lazy spirals before falling in perfect rings around the craft. Too perfect. The entire colony site spread below them like something arranged by a careful hand.

"No structural damage," Reeves said from his station, already running salvage metrics. "Habitat pods intact. Solar arrays still operational after forty years. That's... unusual."

Chen didn't respond. She was looking at the personal belongings scattered across the compound—except *scattered* wasn't the right word. A child's toy sat in the exact center of a cleared circle. Work tools lined up in geometric patterns between the hab units. A row of boots, paired and positioned at precise intervals.

"Looks like they evacuated cleanly," Jordan said, already standing by the airlock. They seemed eager, almost impatient. "Should be straightforward salvage assessment."

Amara didn't look convinced. Her hand drifted to the medkit at her side. "Evacuated where? The rescue window closed thirty-eight years ago."

"Let's move," Chen said. She wasn't here to speculate. They had forty-eight hours to gather salvage data, assess what could be recovered, and justify this entire detour to the board. Every minute on the surface was a minute they couldn't afford to waste.

The surface air was thin, breathable but cold enough to make Chen's breath fog the inside of her helmet. Temperature: minus-fifteen Celsius. The dry climate had preserved everything—plastic, metal, fabric. Even the faded photographs pinned inside the habitat windows looked fresh, their subjects smiling at the camera from forty years ago.

Reeves crouched near one of the tool arrangements, scanning it with his handheld. "Organized. Intentional positioning. Look at this—seven wrenches, arranged by size, all handles pointing... southeast?" He stood, checking his compass. "Yeah. Southeast. Why would anyone do that?"

"Does it matter?" Jordan asked. They were already walking ahead toward the main structure, a low bunker half-buried in the hillside. "We're documenting salvage, not psychology."

But Amara was kneeling now, examining the dust patterns. Footprints led in every direction, overlapping, chaotic—until they reached the cleared areas. Then nothing. Just smooth, undisturbed dust forming those perfect geometric boundaries.

"Commander," she said quietly. "These prints. They stop at the edges of the patterns. Like people walked to a specific point and then... stopped walking."

Chen felt something cold settle in her chest. "Keep moving. We're on a clock."

The elevator shaft was hidden at the back of the main structure, concealed behind a collapsed storage unit that had been moved aside—recently, judging by the fresh scrape marks in the dust. The controls still functioned when Reeves bypassed the lock. Emergency power, somehow sustained after four decades.

"Two hundred meters down," Reeves said, reading the depth gauge. "They built deep. Probably for thermal stability."

The elevator cage groaned as it descended. Chen counted the seconds, watching the shaft walls pass through the mesh: bare rock, support struts, conduit lines still humming with faint electricity. The temperature dropped with each meter. By the time they reached the bottom, their breath was fogging the air.

The doors opened onto darkness.

Then the lights came on—emergency strips along the walls, casting everything in cold white. The chamber was massive, carved from bedrock, and in the center—

"Jesus," Reeves whispered.

Forty-three hibernation pods, arranged in a spiral.

Not a grid. Not rows. A *spiral*, tightening inward toward a central point where the smallest pod sat like the eye of a storm. Each pod glowed with faint internal light, control panels blinking in slow, synchronized rhythms.

Chen forced herself forward, her tactical training overriding the instinct to retreat. The pods were functional. Impossible, but functional. She stopped at the nearest unit and checked the display.

**VITAL SIGNS: ACTIVE**
**STATUS: HIBERNATION MAINTAINED**
**DAYS ELAPSED: 14,847**

"Amara," she said. "Scan this."

The medic was already moving, her handheld unit out and sweeping across the pod's occupant—a woman in her thirties, eyes closed, skin pale but unbroken by decay. The medical scanner beeped steadily.

"Heartbeat," Amara said, her voice tight. "Slow, but present. Brain activity minimal but detectable. Commander, these people are *alive*."

"That's impossible," Reeves said. "Supplies ran out forty years ago. Hibernation pods need external support—nutrients, maintenance, power cycling. You can't just leave someone in stasis indefinitely."

"I'm reading what I'm reading." Amara moved to another pod, then another, her scanner painting each with green biometric overlays. "All forty-three. Alive. Sustained somehow."

Jordan had drifted toward the center of the spiral. They stood there, staring at the smallest pod, their expression distant.

"Jordan," Chen called. "Stay with the group."

They didn't respond immediately. When they finally turned, their smile was faint, distracted. "Sorry. Just... it's beautiful, isn't it? The pattern."

Chen didn't think *beautiful* was the word she'd choose.

Amara found the terminal half-buried under a collapsed workstation near the back wall. It took Reeves three minutes to bypass the lock, another two to power it on. The screen flickered to life, blue and archaic, displaying a directory of colony logs dating back to initial settlement.

"Start at Day 540," Chen said. "Last recorded date before silence."

Reeves queued it up. The video feed was grainy, timestamp burned into the corner: **Day 540 | 18:47 GST**. A man in his fifties sat in front of the camera, his expression serene. Too serene.

"This will be our final log entry," he said. His voice was calm, measured. "The integration is complete. We've achieved what we came here to discover—connection. True connection. Not the shallow exchanges of language or touch, but understanding at a fundamental level."

He leaned closer to the camera. Behind him, other colonists moved in synchronized patterns, their hands touching each other's shoulders, foreheads, breathing in perfect unison.

"We've been waiting," the man continued. And then his mouth moved strangely, lips forming sounds that didn't match, and other voices emerged—overlapping, harmonizing, speaking through him: *"We'll wait. They'll send others."*

The feed cut to static.

Amara's hands were shaking as she scrolled backward. "Day 380," she said.

The screen showed a group of colonists in the mess hall, their faces flushed with excitement. One woman spoke: "We've made a breakthrough in communication. It started during the shared sleep sessions—dreams, overlapping. We thought it was psychological, but it's more than that. It's... communion."

Another colonist touched her forehead to the speaker's, and they both smiled, breathing in sync.

"Day 120," Amara whispered, clicking further back.

The video showed the early days: colonists discussing their research into signal patterns, their excitement about potential first contact, their careful experiments with consciousness-expansion techniques. It all seemed so innocent.

"Turn it off," Chen said.

"Commander—"

"Turn it off." Chen's voice was flat. She'd seen enough. This wasn't salvage. This was a warning no one had heard.

Behind them, one of the hibernation pods hissed softly.

---

Jordan was closest. They turned toward the sound, and Chen saw their expression shift—recognition, maybe, or anticipation. The pod nearest the spiral's center was opening, its lid sliding back with a soft hydraulic sigh.

Inside, a young woman began to wake. Her eyes fluttered, unfocused, pupils dilating in the white light. Her hand lifted slowly, reaching up toward the lid—toward Jordan, who had stepped closer without seeming to notice they'd moved.

"Jordan, step back," Chen ordered.

But Jordan was already reaching down. Their gloved fingers brushed the woman's bare hand, and the contact was brief—barely two seconds—but Chen saw Jordan's entire body stiffen. Their eyes went wide, then distant, and their mouth opened slightly as if listening to something only they could hear.

The woman's lips moved. No sound emerged, but Jordan flinched as if struck.

"Jordan!" Chen grabbed their shoulder, yanking them backward. Jordan stumbled, their expression dazed, confused. The woman in the pod settled back, her eyes drifting closed again, and the lid hissed shut with a finality that felt intentional.

"Did you hear that?" Jordan whispered.

"Hear what?"

Jordan's eyes focused slowly on Chen's face. They blinked, shook their head. "Nothing. I... nothing. Sorry. I don't know why I got so close."

But their hand was still trembling. And when they smiled—trying to reassure, trying to seem normal—the smile didn't quite reach their eyes.

"We're leaving," Chen said. "Now."

No one argued.

---

The lander's engines hummed as they lifted off from the colony site. Chen sat in the command seat, running through post-mission logs while her mind replayed the moment Jordan's hand touched the colonist's skin. The way their expression had changed. The way they'd looked at the spiral of pods like it was something holy.

Jordan was in the pilot's chair, silent, their hands steady on the controls. Too steady. Too calm for someone who'd just made contact with a forty-year-old living corpse.

Amara was running scans in the medical bay, her voice crackling over the comm: "Vitals are normal across the board. No biological anomalies detected. But I want to keep Jordan under observation for the next twenty-four hours. Just precautionary."

"Agreed," Chen said. She glanced at Jordan, whose gaze was fixed on the viewport. "Jordan, you feel alright?"

"Fine," they said. "Better than fine, actually. I feel... clear. Like I slept well for the first time in weeks."

That should have been reassuring. It wasn't.

The *Goliath* loomed ahead, docking bay open and waiting. Chen had a choice to make. Protocal dictated immediate departure if contamination was suspected. But the board had been explicit: no return without actionable salvage data. Forty-eight hours minimum on-site to justify the detour.

They couldn't afford to leave empty-handed.

"We're staying," Chen said. "Minimum assessment period. Reeves, you'll compile surface salvage reports. Amara, keep monitoring Jordan and run biohazard protocols. Volkov, I want full ship diagnostics—life support, engines, quarantine systems. If anything looks wrong, we abort."

"Understood," Volkov's voice came through, relief evident. "Good to have you back, Commander."

But as the lander docked and the crew disembarked, Chen caught Jordan standing just a moment too long in the airlock, staring back toward the planet's surface. Their expression was distant, almost wistful.

"Jordan?"

They turned, smiled. "Coming."

And maybe it was nothing. Maybe it was fatigue, or stress, or the adrenaline crash after a tense mission.

But when Jordan walked past her, Chen noticed they stood just a little closer than usual. Their shoulder brushed hers, and the contact felt—wrong. Too warm. Too deliberate.

And in the back of her mind, Chen remembered the final log entry. The man's serene expression as multiple voices spoke through his mouth:

*We'll wait. They'll send others.*

They'd sent others.

And now the others were here.
