Something to reflect upon. (1s)

Imagine a candle flame. (1.5s)
It flickers with every breath, (1s)
But it never goes out. (2s)
That flame is your inner light. (6s)

Make yourself comfortable… (0.5s) Find a position that feels supportive… (0.8s) And when you're ready, (0.5s) let your eyelids rest. (4.5s)

Breathe in gently… (4s)
And out. (4.5s)
In… (4s)
Out… (5s)
Settling into stillness. (3s)

Picture a candle in front of you. (2s)
In the darkness, (0.5s) just this single flame. (4s)

Watch it glow. (2s)
Steady… (1.5s) warm… (1.5s) peaceful. (5s)

As you breathe in, (0.5s) the flame flickers slightly. (2.5s)
As you breathe out, (0.5s) it steadies again. (5s)

In… (4s) flicker… (2s)
Out… (5s) steady. (3s)

Keep watching the flame. (2s)
Let your breath be gentle, (0.8s) so the flame stays calm. (6s)

This flame represents your awareness. (2s)
Always here. (1.5s)
Always present. (2s)
Even when everything around you is dark. (6s)

Thoughts are like wind. (1.5s)
They make the flame dance, (0.8s)
But they can't blow it out. (5s)

Just keep breathing softly. (2s)
Watching the flame. (10s)

Notice its warmth. (2s)
Not burning… (1s) just gentle warmth. (3s)
That's the warmth of your own presence. (6s)

Let the flame fill your vision. (3s)
Nothing else exists… (1.5s)
Just this light… (1.5s)
And your breath. (12s)

The flame is always here. (2s)
You can return to it whenever you need peace. (8s)

Take one more deep breath. (4s)
And as you exhale, (0.8s) slowly let the image fade. (3s)

But feel the warmth remaining. (2s)
That light is inside you. (6s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Begin to stir gently… (1.5s)
Opening your eyes if there's more to do… (1.5s)
Otherwise, (1s) keep the flame glowing within with eyes closed, (1s) drifting into peaceful rest. (5s)
