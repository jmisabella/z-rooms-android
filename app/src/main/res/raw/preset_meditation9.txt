Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this (4s)

Anxiety pulls you into tomorrow (1s)
Or drags you back to yesterday. (1.5s)
But your body… (1s) your breath… (1s) your senses… (1.2s)
They only exist right now. (2s)
And right now… (1s) you're okay. (6s)

Settle into your space… (1.5s) and let your eyes close. (5s)

This practice is about coming home to the body… (1.5s)
When the mind is spinning. (5s)

Let's begin with the five senses. (3s)
This brings us immediately into the present. (5s)

First, (0.3s) notice five things you can hear. (2s)
Don't search… (0.8s) just notice what's already there. (10s)

Now, (0.3s) four things you can feel. (2s)
Your clothes on your skin… (2s)
The temperature of the air… (2s)
Your breath moving in your chest… (2s)
Your feet on the floor. (6s)

Three things you could smell if you paid attention. (2s)
Maybe the air itself… (2s)
Or a hint of something in the room. (6s)

And even with your eyes closed, (0.8s) notice the quality of light or darkness. (4s)
Just acknowledging sight, (0.6s) even in this form. (6s)

Now bring it all together. (2s)
Hearing… (2s) feeling… (2s) being here. (8s)

Let's anchor into the breath. (3s)
Place one hand on your belly. (3s)
Feel it rise with the in-breath… (3s)
And fall with the out-breath. (6s)

Follow that movement. (2s)
Rising… (4s) falling… (5s)
Rising… (4s) falling… (5s)

When anxiety comes, (0.6s) it pulls us into the future… (1.2s)
Into "what if" and "what might." (3s)
But your breath only happens now. (2s)
It's an anchor to this moment. (8s)

Stay with the rising and falling. (14s)

If your mind drifts to worry, (0.6s)
Gently say to yourself, (0.5s)
"Not now… (1s) right now I'm just breathing." (6s)

And return to the belly… (1.5s)
Rising… (4.5s) falling… (6s)

You're safe in this moment. (3s)
Right here… (1s) right now… (1s) you're okay. (10s)

Keep breathing. (16s)

When you're ready to come back… (2.5s)
Wiggle your fingers and toes… (2s)
Take a full, (0.3s) deep breath… (3s)
And open your eyes slowly. (4s)

You can return to your breath anytime. (5s)
