Night and Day (3s)

Night and Day were born as siblings, (1s)
carved from the same original whole, (1s)
split into rivals at the world's beginning, (1s)
each claiming half of every soul. (3s)

Day arrives with arms full of color, (1s)
draped in gold and burning bright, (1s)
carrying noise and heat and hunger, (1s)
pushing back the realm of Night. (3s)

Night comes wearing starlit silence, (1s)
robed in indigo and silver threads, (1s)
bringing rest and dream and violence, (1s)
the whispered fears inside our heads. (3s)

They chase each other endlessly, (1s)
around the turning of the sphere, (1s)
Day pursuing Night's mystery, (1s)
Night hunting Day's frontier. (3s)

Day thinks Night is cold and empty, (1s)
nothing but an absence, a void to fill, (1s)
while Night sees Day as far too plenty, (1s)
too loud, too bright, too much, too shrill. (3s)

But neither one can stand alone (1s)
Day would burn the world to ash, (1s)
Night would freeze it into stone, (1s)
one eternal, lifeless clash. (3s)

They need each other's boundaries, (1s)
the edge where light meets dark, (1s)
the moment of exchange, the keys (1s)
that one hands off, the other's spark. (3s)

Day brings growth but Night brings healing, (1s)
Day exposes, (1s)
Night conceals, (1s)
Day is action, Night is feeling, (1s)
what one opens, one reveals. (3s)

Ancient siblings, ancient rivals, (1s)
forever locked in their routine, (1s)
teaching us through their arrivals (1s)
that opposites define what's in between. (3s)

We are made of both their natures, (1s)
carry Day's fire, Night's deep well, (1s)
walking contradictions, dual creatures, (1s)
learning what they know so well (3s)

That strength needs rest to be sustainable, (1s)
that clarity requires the dark, (1s)
that nothing whole is ever stable (1s)
without its complementary counterpart. (3s)

So Day and Night continue turning, (1s)
chasing, fleeing, giving way, (1s)
Night forever slowly learning (1s)
that it needs the shape of Day, (3s)

And Day discovering in silence (1s)
that its brilliance needs the contrast, (1s)
that their endless, ancient violence (1s)
is the love that makes them last. (3s)
