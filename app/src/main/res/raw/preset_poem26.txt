The Siblings (3s)

Night and Day were born as siblings, (2s)
carved from the same original whole, (2s)
split into rivals at the world's beginning, (3s)
each claiming half of every soul. (4s)

Day arrives with arms full of color, (2s)
draped in gold and burning bright, (3s)
carrying noise and heat and hunger, (3s)
pushing back the realm of Night. (4s)

Night comes wearing starlit silence, (2s)
robed in indigo and silver threads, (3s)
bringing rest and dream and violence, (3s)
the whispered fears inside our heads. (4s)

They chase each other endlessly, (2s)
around the turning of the sphere, (3s)
Day pursuing Night's mystery, (3s)
Night hunting Day's frontier. (4s)

Day thinks Night is cold and empty, (2s)
nothing but an absence, a void to fill, (3s)
while Night sees Day as far too plenty, (3s)
too loud, too bright, too much, too shrill. (4s)

But neither one can stand alone. (3s)
Day would burn the world to ash, (3s)
Night would freeze it into stone. (5s)

They need the edge where light meets dark, (3s)
the moment of exchange, (3s)
that one hands off, the other's spark. (5s)
