Interval (3s)

The pool forms (2s)
in the hollow of the rock, (2s)
filled by what the ocean performs (2s)
with rhythm you can't stop or block. (4s)

Water rushes in, (2s)
claims the space between the stones. (3s)
For a moment, something begins— (2s)
stillness in the temporary zones. (4s)

You can see the bottom clear. (2s)
Small life suspended there. (3s)
The brief window when it's near (2s)
enough to study, trapped in air. (4s)

But the next wave builds. (3s)

You watch it come, (2s)
see how the pool fills (2s)
then drains back to the sum. (4s)

The rhythm holds you (2s)
in its patient repetition. (3s)
What the water shows you (2s)
forms and finds completion. (4s)

There's no controlling when (2s)
the tide arrives or leaves. (3s)
You can only witness, then (2s)
accept what the ocean achieves. (4s)

The pool will fill again. (3s)
Will hold. (2s)
Will drain. (3s)
The cycle, old (2s)
as stone. (4s)

Not permanent. (3s)
Just present. (3s)

The pool holds (2s)
what the waves permit, (2s)
until the ocean folds (2s)
back over it. (5s)
