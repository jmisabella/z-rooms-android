The Chain (3s)

You remember when a decade felt like forever, (1s)
when summers stretched impossibly long, (1s)
when the world of your parents seemed so clever, (1s)
so distant from where you belonged. (2s)

But time has a way of collapsing the distance, (1s)
of folding the years into now (1s)
what once seemed like ancient existence (1s)
is suddenly close, somehow. (3s)

The gap between then and today grows thinner, (1s)
the differences start to fade, (1s)
you see yourself in the child, the beginner, (1s)
in choices your grandparents made. (3s)

We are more alike than we are different, (1s)
more connected than we know (1s)
the same hopes, the same fear of what's imminent, (1s)
the same need to love and to grow. (3s)

You are part of an endless progression, (1s)
a link in a chain so long, (1s)
carrying forward the same old questions, (1s)
singing the same human song. (3s)

The past isn't distant or foreign, (1s)
it lives in your breath, in your hands (1s)
we are only human, we are only human, (1s)
trying our best where we stand. (3s)

Time moves faster the longer you're living, (1s)
the years blend and blur into one, (1s)
but there's comfort in finally seeing (1s)
we've always been under the same sun. (3s)
