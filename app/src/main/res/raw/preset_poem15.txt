Threshold (3s)

You stand (2s)
with one hand on the frame, (2s)
weight balanced (1s)
between the same (3s)

two rooms you've crossed (2s)
a thousand times before. (3s)
Neither gained nor lost, (2s)
neither in nor through the door. (4s)

Light from both sides (2s)
meets upon your skin. (3s)
Where one room divides (2s)
from where you might begin. (4s)

You've learned to stay (2s)
here, in the between, (3s)
the place that won't betray (2s)
by being one or the other scene. (4s)

How many times (2s)
have you paused like this, (3s)
caught between the lines, (2s)
between what is and what you miss. (4s)

The doorway holds (2s)
what the rooms cannot— (3s)
the story that unfolds (2s)
in the space that's not. (4s)

Not here. (2s)
Not there. (2s)
Just this narrow (1s)
strip of air (3s)

where you've been standing (2s)
longer than you meant. (3s)
Both rooms demanding, (2s)
pulling where you went. (4s)

You could cross. (3s)

You could choose. (3s)

But the threshold (2s)
is what you refuse (2s)
to lose. (5s)
