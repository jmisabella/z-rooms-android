The Chain (3s)

You remember when a decade felt like forever, (1s)
when summers stretched impossibly long, (1s)
when the world of your parents seemed so clever, (1s)
so distant from where you belonged. (3s)

But time has a way of collapsing the distance, (1s)
of folding the years into now (1s)
what once seemed like ancient existence (1s)
is suddenly close, somehow. (4s)

You see yourself in the child, the beginner, (1s)
in choices your grandparents made, (1s)
a link in a chain so long, (1s)
carrying forward the same old questions. (4s)

Past isn't distant or foreign, (1s)
it lives in your breath, in your hands (1s)
we are only human, we are only human, (2s)
trying our best where we stand. (4s)

Time moves faster the longer you're living, (1s)
the years blend and blur into one, (1s)
but there's comfort in finally seeing (1s)
we've always been under the same sun. (4s)
