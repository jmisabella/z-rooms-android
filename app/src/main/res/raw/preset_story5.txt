# Chapter 4: Erosion

**Day 4–5 | MSCS Goliath, Tantalus V Orbit**

## Sabotage

The navigation computer crashed at 0623 hours.

Volkov was running his morning diagnostics when the primary nav system went dark. Not offline—dark. Like someone had reached in and severed the power coupling mid-calculation. Every backup protocol failed to engage. Every redundancy sat silent.

He stared at the blank screen for three seconds before his training kicked in.

"Bridge, this is engineering. Primary nav system is down. Running diagnostics now."

Chen's response came immediately. "Cause?"

"Unknown. Give me ten minutes."

He pulled up the system logs. The navigation computer had been running trajectory recalculations—routine work, verifying their departure window, plotting course corrections. Standard operations. Then at 0623:17, the entire system had simply stopped. No error cascade. No gradual degradation. Just full stop.

Volkov opened the access panel behind the engineering console. The hardware should tell him what the software couldn't. He grabbed his diagnostic scanner, aimed it at the nav computer's processing core.

The scanner beeped. Error. He adjusted the calibration, tried again. Same error.

He blinked, shook his head. Fatigue? Spatial reasoning still compromised? He could see the processing core right there—fifteen centimeters into the access panel, slightly to the left of the power distribution node.

He reached for it. His hand stopped twelve centimeters short. Wrong depth perception. Again.

"Blyat." He tried again, slower, watching his hand move through space like he was learning to use it for the first time. Made contact on the third attempt. Pulled the processing core free.

The component was warm. Too warm. Not overheating—just running hotter than baseline. He ran the scanner across its surface. Processing showed elevated thermal signature but no damage. No corruption. No obvious failure point.

He pulled up the activity logs. The nav computer had been processing standard calculations when something—he scrolled through the access records—something had queried the system. Not standard ship operations. Not Chen's command authorization. Not HERMES AI maintenance.

Unauthorized access. At 0623:14. Three seconds before the crash.

The query had come from inside the ship. From a terminal in the cargo bay.

Volkov's hands went cold.

He opened the comm. "Commander, we have a problem."

---

Chen stood in the cargo bay, looking at the terminal Volkov had identified. Reeves stood beside her, expression carefully neutral. Jordan hovered near the doorway, concern painted on their features. Amara remained on the bridge, monitoring from a distance.

"This terminal accessed the navigation computer," Volkov said. He stood at the console, diagnostic scanner in hand. "At 0623:14. Query ran for three seconds. System crashed immediately after."

"What kind of query?" Chen asked.

"Looking at departure trajectory calculations. Specifically: optimal exit window, fuel consumption estimates, emergency abort parameters." Volkov pulled up the access logs. "Someone was reviewing our escape options."

"Who accessed it?" Chen's voice was flat. Command voice. The one that didn't reveal whether she already suspected the answer.

"Terminal log shows..." Volkov paused. "Manual override. Authorization bypassed. No user ID recorded."

"Someone covered their tracks," Reeves observed.

"Da. Professional job. Knew exactly what to erase." Volkov turned to Chen. "But thermal signature on console shows it was used approximately seven hours ago. Around 2330 last night. And again at 0620 this morning."

Chen checked her mental timeline. 2330 hours—mid-sleep cycle for most of the crew. Who had been awake?

"I was on watch until midnight," Jordan said. Their voice was helpful, cooperative. "I was on the bridge the whole time. Didn't come down to cargo."

"I was sleeping," Reeves said. "Quarters. Ask HERMES if you don't believe me. Environmental sensors track movement."

"I was in med bay," Amara's voice came through the comm. "Reviewing colony medical logs. Again. HERMES can verify."

Volkov said nothing. He'd been in engineering. Alone. No witnesses. No environmental sensors in some sections because they'd been deemed non-essential to save on maintenance costs.

Chen studied each of them in turn. Three people with opportunity. One of them lying.

Or maybe none of them lying. Maybe the person who accessed the terminal genuinely didn't remember doing it. Maybe whoever was compromised wasn't fully in control during the access. Maybe they'd woken up at their station with no memory of how they got there.

The infection could do that. The colony logs had shown colonists reporting lost time. Gaps in memory. Performing actions without conscious awareness.

"Volkov, can you restore nav function?" Chen asked.

"Da. Already working on it. Processing core looks intact. Just needs reinstall and reboot. Maybe ninety minutes."

"Do it. Reeves, pull access logs for every terminal on the ship for the past seventy-two hours. I want to know who accessed what and when. Jordan, you're with me. We're checking the bridge systems manually."

"Commander, should we consider that HERMES might be compromised?" Reeves asked carefully. "If someone's been manipulating ship systems, the AI might not be reliable witness."

Chen had already thought of that. Had been trying not to think of that. "Run diagnostics on HERMES core systems. But quietly. If the AI is compromised, I don't want whoever did it to know we're checking."

"Understood."

They dispersed to their tasks. Chen headed for the bridge with Jordan following three steps behind—close enough to be present, far enough to maintain professional distance.

Except when they reached the UV sterilization corridor, Jordan's path shifted toward the cargo bay alternate route again.

"Jordan," Chen said. "Direct route."

Jordan stopped. Turned back. Their smile was apologetic, slightly embarrassed. "Sorry. Habit. The cargo route's usually faster when I'm carrying equipment."

"You're not carrying equipment."

"Right. Yeah. Sorry, Commander." Jordan walked through the UV corridor. Chen watched their posture. Watched for flinching, discomfort, any sign of photosensitivity.

Nothing obvious. Jordan walked through the purple-blue light with normal stride, normal breathing.

But their shoulders were tight. Their jaw was clenched. And the moment they cleared the field, their posture relaxed by measurable degrees.

UV avoidance. Confirmed.

Chen filed it away. Kept walking. Kept projecting calm professionalism while her tactical instincts screamed warnings.

Someone on her crew was sabotaging ship systems. Someone was trying to keep them here. Someone was compromised and either didn't know it or was hiding it with practiced skill.

And she had thirty-one hours until scheduled departure. Thirty-one hours to identify the threat, contain it, and get her crew home alive.

Simple. Professional. Survivable.

If she acted fast enough.

If she was right about who was compromised.

If she wasn't already too late.

## Helpful Hands

Volkov had the navigation processing core in his hands when Jordan appeared in the engineering bay doorway.

"Hey. Heard you were fixing the nav system. Need an extra set of hands?"

Volkov looked up. Jordan stood in the doorway, relaxed and friendly, offering help the way they always had. The way they'd done on a dozen previous missions when Volkov needed assistance with complex repairs.

Nothing suspicious about it. Nothing wrong.

Except Volkov's fifteen years of engineering experience was screaming at him to say no.

"Is fine. Just reinstallation. Quick work." He turned back to the processing core, trying to position it correctly in the access panel. Trying to compensate for spatial reasoning that refused to cooperate.

"Come on, it'll go faster with two people." Jordan stepped into the bay, moving to the console. "I can monitor the diagnostic readout while you handle the hardware. Like we did on that coolant repair last month."

That had worked well. Jordan had good instincts for systems integration. Had caught a power distribution error Volkov might have missed.

So why did every instinct tell him to refuse the help?

"Da, okay. You monitor diagnostics. I install core." Volkov positioned the component, lined it up with the interface socket. His hands were shaking slightly. Fatigue and stress and the constant awareness that simple tasks had become effortful.

"Diagnostic panel's ready," Jordan said. "Whenever you want to slot it in."

Volkov pushed the processing core into place. It seated with a satisfying click. Status lights flickered to life—green, amber, cycling through initialization sequence.

"Looking good," Jordan said. "Power distribution nominal. Data bus connecting. Should be online in thirty seconds."

Twenty seconds later, the amber lights went red.

"Wait, what?" Jordan leaned over the panel. "That's... hold on. Error cascade in the secondary processors. That's not right."

Volkov pulled the core back out, inspected it. No visible damage. Connectors clean. Everything looked correct. "Retry. Maybe initialization sequence failed. Happens sometimes."

He reseated the core. Same initialization pattern. Green, amber, cycling—red.

"Same error," Jordan said. "Looks like corrupted firmware. The core needs reflashing before it'll accept commands."

"Firmware was fine thirty minutes ago." Volkov pulled up the diagnostic data on his tablet. Jordan was right—the firmware had somehow corrupted. But firmware didn't spontaneously corrupt. Not without cause.

"Must have happened during the crash," Jordan said. "Sometimes when systems go down hard, the firmware gets scrambled. It's rare, but I've seen it before."

Volkov had seen it too. Extremely rare. Required specific conditions—power surge, radiation exposure, physical trauma. None of which had occurred.

"How long to reflash?" he asked.

Jordan checked the technical manual. "Uh... looks like six to eight hours. Assuming we have a clean backup."

"Six to eight hours." Volkov felt his chest tighten. That extended their schedule. Pushed them closer to the point where departure might require additional fuel calculations, additional risk assessment.

Additional time in orbit around Tantalus V.

"I can handle the reflashing," Jordan offered. "It's mostly automated. Just needs monitoring. You've got other diagnostics to run, right? Might as well multitask."

It was logical. Efficient. Exactly the kind of practical task division they'd done a hundred times before.

Volkov looked at Jordan's face. Saw only genuine helpfulness. Saw the pilot he'd trained with, worked with, trusted with ship operations for the past three missions.

Saw someone who'd made physical contact with an infected colonist seventy-two hours ago and had been acting subtly wrong ever since.

"No," Volkov said. "I will handle reflashing. You return to bridge. Commander needs someone on navigation console."

Jordan's expression flickered. Just for a moment. Disappointment, maybe. Or frustration. Then the helpful mask slid back into place. "Sure. Whatever works. Just trying to help, Volkov."

"I know. I appreciate. But is better I handle all nav system repairs personally. Chain of accountability." The lie came easier than Volkov expected. Years of bureaucratic salvage work had taught him how to cite protocols that didn't quite exist.

"Right. Yeah, that makes sense." Jordan nodded, started toward the door, then paused. "Hey, Volkov? You're doing a great job. I know things have been hard since hibernation—the spatial reasoning stuff, I mean—but you're handling it really well. Just wanted you to know that."

The kindness felt like a weapon.

Volkov forced a smile. "Thank you. Is getting better. Brain just needs time to... adjust."

"Exactly. Adjustment. That's all this is." Jordan's smile was warm, genuine, fundamentally wrong in ways Volkov couldn't articulate. "We're all adjusting. It's going to be fine."

They left. The engineering bay door sealed.

Volkov stood alone, staring at the corrupted processing core, and thought about how conveniently the firmware had failed. How perfectly the timing extended their repair schedule. How Jordan had been right there to offer help that would have given them direct access to the navigation systems.

He pulled up the processing core's internal logs. Scrolled through the access history. Found what he was looking for at timestamp 0620:47—exactly three minutes before the crash.

Someone had accessed the core remotely. Sent a command that deliberately corrupted the firmware. Made it look like spontaneous failure.

Professional work. Knew exactly what to break and how to make it seem natural.

Volkov pulled up ship security logs. Cross-referenced terminal access with the remote command timestamp. Found the cargo bay terminal again. Same unauthorized access. Same manual override.

But this time, environmental sensors had caught something. Heat signature near the terminal at 0620:45. Human-sized. Human-shaped.

The sensors couldn't identify who. But they confirmed someone had been there. Someone had sabotaged the navigation system deliberately.

Someone was trying to keep them here.

Volkov opened his private log. Started a new entry: *Day 4, 0745 hours. Navigation system deliberately sabotaged. Firmware corrupted via remote access from cargo bay terminal. Subject unknown, but timing coincides with Subject Jordan Hayes offering assistance. Hypothesis: Jordan is compromised and actively working against crew survival. Evidence: circumstantial but mounting. Recommendation: Inform commander immediately. Risk: If wrong, destroy crew cohesion. If right, may trigger confrontation before crew is ready.*

He saved the entry. Encrypted it. And made his choice.

He opened the comm to the bridge. "Commander, engineering bay. Need to speak with you. Privately. Soon as possible."

Chen's response came immediately. "On my way."

---

## The Accusation

Chen stood in the engineering bay, reading Volkov's log entries on his tablet. The evidence was circumstantial. Damning, but circumstantial.

Navigation system accessed from cargo bay: no user ID.
Firmware corruption: timestamp matches Jordan's probable location.
UV avoidance: confirmed but explainable as coincidence.
Proximity-seeking behavior: documented by multiple crew.
Enhanced cognitive performance: medically verified but not necessarily threatening.
Unusual social patterns: subjective observation, not objective fact.

By themselves, each data point could be explained away. Stress. Fatigue. Normal post-contact recovery.

Together, they formed a pattern Chen's tactical training insisted meant threat.

"You are certain?" she asked Volkov.

"No. But certain enough to be wrong if I do nothing and Jordan is compromised. Not certain enough to be right if I accuse and Jordan is clean." He looked exhausted. Terrified. "Commander, I do not know what to do. Tell me what to do."

Chen had commanded crews for twelve years. Had made hard decisions in situations with incomplete information. This should be familiar territory.

But this was different. This was accusing a crew member of being an infection vector. Of being compromised by something they'd found on a dead colony. Of being not quite human anymore.

If she was wrong, she destroyed crew cohesion. Jordan would never trust her again. The others would question her judgment. Mission failure.

If she was right and did nothing, whatever had taken Jordan would continue spreading. Would continue sabotaging. Would kill them all.

Command meant choosing between bad options and living with the consequences.

"I will confront Jordan," Chen said. "Directly. Observe their reactions. If they are compromised, confrontation may trigger defensive behavior—make the infection obvious. If they are clean, they will respond with appropriate confusion and cooperation."

"And if confrontation triggers violence?" Volkov asked quietly.

Chen patted the service pistol hidden under her jacket. "Then I am prepared."

---

She found Jordan on the bridge, running system checks at the navigation console. Professional. Competent. Normal.

"Jordan, I need to speak with you. Conference room. Now."

Jordan looked up, surprised. "Is everything okay, Commander?"

"Conference room." Chen kept her voice neutral. Command voice. The one that didn't invite questions.

"Aye, Commander." Jordan followed her to the small conference space adjacent to the bridge—four chairs, one table, door that sealed for private discussions.

Chen waited until the door closed. Positioned herself between Jordan and the exit. Close enough to react if necessary. Far enough to avoid immediate physical threat.

"Where were you at 0620 this morning?" she asked.

Jordan blinked. "My quarters. Sleeping. Why?"

"Someone accessed the cargo bay terminal at 0620. Remotely corrupted the navigation system firmware. Extended our repair schedule by six to eight hours."

"Okay." Jordan's expression showed concern. Appropriate concern. "Do we know who?"

"Security logs show a heat signature at the cargo bay at 0620:45. Human-sized. The terminal was accessed manually."

"So someone was physically there." Jordan frowned, thinking through the implications. "But I was in quarters. HERMES can verify—"

"HERMES logs show you left your quarters at 0605. Returned at 0635."

The statement hung in the air between them.

Jordan's expression shifted—confusion first, then understanding, then something that looked like hurt. "You think I sabotaged the navigation system."

"Did you?"

"No. Commander, I would never—" Jordan stopped. Started again. "I don't even remember leaving my quarters. I went to sleep at 0100. Woke up at 0700. If HERMES says I was moving around, then... I don't know. Lost time? Sleep walking?"

"You have never sleep-walked before."

"I've never made contact with a forty-year-old living corpse before either." Jordan's voice rose slightly. Frustration bleeding through. "Maybe that changes things. Maybe I'm having stress responses I don't remember. But I would not sabotage ship systems. That would kill us all. Why would I do that?"

"You tell me."

"There's nothing to tell!" Jordan stood. Chen's hand moved to her weapon. Jordan noticed, stopped moving. Their expression shifted to something like disbelief. "Commander. You think I'm compromised. You think I'm... what? Infected? Taken over? You think I'm not me anymore?"

"You have been exhibiting anomalous behavior since surface contact. UV avoidance. Proximity-seeking. Enhanced cognitive performance. Lost time. And now suspected sabotage during a period you claim not to remember." Chen kept her voice flat. Clinical. "If you are compromised, you may not be aware of your own actions. The colony logs showed subjects performing complex tasks with no conscious memory. Martinez spoke with multiple voices through one mouth and seemed unaware anything was wrong."

Jordan's jaw clenched. "I am not Martinez. I am Jordan Hayes. I'm your pilot. I've been on your crew for two years. We've survived three missions together. I have never given you reason to distrust me."

"Until seventy-two hours ago when you touched an infected colonist and your behavior changed."

"Changed how?" Jordan's voice carried an edge now. Anger. "I'm sleeping better. Thinking clearer. Working more efficiently. Those are good things, Commander. Those are signs of recovery from hibernation damage, not infection."

"Or signs that the infection has progressed beyond detection. Enhanced performance to ensure host survival while the entity establishes control." Chen pulled up the colony logs on her tablet, turned it so Jordan could see Martinez's footage. "She said the same things. Said she was better. Clearer. More connected. Right up until multiple voices started speaking through her mouth."

Jordan watched the footage. Their expression was unreadable. When Martinez's harmonized voices emerged—*We'll wait, they'll send others*—Jordan flinched.

"That's not what's happening to me," they said quietly.

"Prove it."

"How? What evidence would satisfy you? The medical scans are clean. My behavior is explicable as stress response. The lost time could be sleep disruption. You have suspicions, Commander, not proof. You're seeing patterns that might not exist."

"Or I am seeing patterns you are not aware you are creating." Chen moved closer. "Jordan. If you are compromised—if something is influencing you without your conscious awareness—I need you to fight it. I need you to help me understand what is happening. We can contain this. We can help you. But only if you are honest."

Jordan's expression crumpled. For a moment, they looked young and scared and entirely themselves. "Commander, I don't know. I don't... I can't remember leaving my quarters. I don't remember accessing any terminals. But I also don't remember the dreams from hibernation until you showed me the logs. I don't remember—" They stopped. Breath shaking. "There are gaps. Time I can't account for. Thoughts that don't feel like mine. Sensations of presence when I'm alone. But I'm still me. I'm still in control. I'm still Jordan."

"Are you?"

The question landed like accusation. Like diagnosis.

Jordan looked at Chen with an expression that might have been pleading or might have been calculation. "I don't know. How would I know? If something was replacing me piece by piece, would I notice? Or would I just feel like I was getting better?"

It was the most honest thing anyone had said since they woke from hibernation.

Chen made her decision.

"You are confined to quarters until we depart. Medical observation. Limited system access. Meals delivered. This is for your protection and the crew's safety."

"Commander—"

"This is not negotiable. Either you accept confinement voluntarily, or I will enforce it. Choose."

Jordan's expression shifted. The fear drained away. The vulnerability evaporated. What remained was something cooler. Calmer. Fundamentally other.

"You are making a mistake," Jordan said. Their voice had that too-patient quality again. That gentle reasonableness that made Chen's skin crawl. "Isolating me won't protect you. The connection is already established. The boundaries are already thinning. You feel it too, don't you, Commander? The emptiness where love used to be? The voices getting louder? We're all adjusting. I'm just further along."

Chen's hand was on her weapon. "Quarters. Now."

Jordan smiled. Warm. Kind. Entirely wrong. "I'll comply. For now. Because I don't want to hurt you. Because you're crew. But you should know—isolation won't stop what's already started. The collective is patient. It can wait. It's been waiting forty years. What's a few more hours?"

The words echoed Martinez's final transmission with horrifying precision.

Chen gestured toward the door. "Move."

Jordan moved. Walked calmly to their quarters. Stepped inside without resistance. Turned to face Chen with that same unsettling serenity.

"We'll talk when you're ready to understand," Jordan said. "I can help you, Commander. I can help all of you. You just have to stop fighting."

Chen sealed the door. Activated emergency lock protocols from her command override. The quarters were now prison. Jordan could not leave without Chen's authorization.

She stood in the corridor, heart pounding, and thought about Martinez's words: *The collective is patient.*

And Jordan's echo: *I'm just further along.*

Further along toward what?

Chen opened the comm. "All crew to bridge. Immediate briefing. Priority alpha."

She had just confined her pilot to quarters. Accused them of sabotage and potential infection. Made an enemy of someone she'd trusted for two years.

And the terrifying part was she didn't know if she'd made the right choice or just started a chain of events that would doom them all.

---

## Crew Fractures

The bridge at 0900 hours felt like a pressure vessel about to rupture. Chen stood at the command station. Volkov leaned against engineering console, arms crossed, expression grim. Amara sat at medical station, tablet in hand, looking like she hadn't slept in days. Reeves stood by salvage assessment terminal, carefully neutral, watching everyone with academic detachment.

Jordan's quarters were sealed. Empty seat at navigation console reminded everyone what was missing.

Chen briefed them quickly, efficiently. The sabotage. The confrontation. Jordan's confession of lost time and the disturbing shift in their final statements. The decision to confine until departure.

"The navigation system will be repaired in six hours," Chen concluded. "We depart as soon as repairs are complete. Until then, Jordan remains confined. No exceptions. Any questions?"

"Is Jordan infected?" Amara asked. Her voice was clinical but her hands were shaking. "Do we have medical confirmation?"

"No," Chen admitted. "Scans are clean. But behavior is consistent with psychological contamination as documented in colony logs. Confinement is precautionary."

"Precautionary," Reeves repeated. "Based on suspicion rather than evidence."

Chen's jaw tightened. "Based on pattern recognition. Multiple behavioral anomalies. Suspected sabotage. Lost time. Personality changes. If you have a better explanation, I'm listening."

"I have a simpler explanation: stress and paranoia." Reeves pulled up Amara's medical notes. "Dr. Osei has documented significant nutritional deprivation. Five kilograms weight loss. Hallucination risk increases dramatically after seventy-two hours without adequate caloric intake. Commander, you've documented memory loss and emotional blunting. Volkov has reported severe spatial reasoning impairment affecting basic task performance. We are all compromised by hibernation damage and post-contact stress. Singling out Jordan as uniquely infected may be projection rather than observation."

"I saw Jordan's expression change," Chen said. "I heard them speak with phrasing that matched Martinez's transmission. That is not projection."

"Or it's expectation bias," Reeves countered. "You've watched those colony logs dozens of times. You're primed to see infection. Human pattern recognition is exceptionally good at finding what we're looking for—even when it's not there."

"So you think I am wrong." Chen kept her voice level. Command voice. But the challenge was clear.

"I think we're all operating with compromised judgment. Including you, Commander. Confining Jordan based on subjective observation and circumstantial evidence sets dangerous precedent. Who gets confined next? Osei, for her severe nutritional crisis? Volkov, for his documented cognitive impairment? Me, for questioning your decisions?"

The argument had logic. Cold, academic logic that felt right and wrong simultaneously.

"I support Commander's decision," Volkov said. "I reviewed the access logs. I saw the sabotage evidence. Jordan was in location at correct time. They admitted to lost time. This is not paranoia. This is pattern recognition."

"You're documenting spatial reasoning impairment," Reeves said. "Your technical assessments may be unreliable. How certain are you that the firmware corruption was sabotage rather than spontaneous failure?"

"Fifteen years experience says—"

"Fifteen years experience with functional spatial cognition. You've documented your impairment. Your judgment may be compromised."

Volkov's face flushed. "Are you saying I am too stupid to recognize sabotage?"

"I'm saying we're all impaired. Making critical decisions based on impaired cognition is dangerous."

"So is doing nothing while crew member is compromised!" Volkov's voice rose. Rare loss of control. "You want to wait until Jordan speaks with multiple voices? Until infection is obvious? By then, too late. We contain threat now, while we can."

"Or we isolate a traumatized crew member and accelerate their psychological breakdown," Reeves shot back. "Solitary confinement is documented torture methodology. If Jordan is experiencing stress response, isolation will worsen it. If they're infected, isolation gives the entity time to consolidate control without observation."

"Better isolated threat than active threat," Volkov said.

"Unless isolation is what the entity wants. Colony logs showed infected colonists isolating uninfected crew before conversion. Martinez confined her medical officer before he joined the collective. We might be following the playbook without realizing it."

The argument was spiraling. Chen could feel crew cohesion fracturing in real time. Volkov and Reeves on opposite sides. Amara silent, documenting everything with clinical detachment. The mission coming apart.

"Enough," Chen said. Command voice. Sharp enough to cut through argument. "Decision is made. Jordan remains confined. Reeves, if you have concerns about my command judgment, file formal protest after we reach Ganymede. Until then, we follow protocol."

"Protocol written for normal salvage operations," Reeves said. "We are operating outside protocol. Outside experience. Improvising responses to unprecedented situation. And improvisation under impaired cognition leads to catastrophic decision-making."

"Then what do you recommend?" Chen's patience was fracturing. "Be specific. What action do you propose instead of confinement?"

Reeves considered. "Comprehensive medical evaluation. All crew. Neurological scans, psychological assessment, comparative analysis. Identify who is compromised and to what degree. Make decisions based on data rather than suspicion."

"The scans show nothing," Amara said quietly. All eyes turned to her. She looked up from her tablet, expression haunted. "I've been running scans continuously. Jordan's scans are clean. Cleaner than baseline. Perfect neural health. If they're infected, the infection is undetectable. If scans can't show it, how do we identify who's compromised?"

"We watch for behavioral tells," Chen said. "UV avoidance. Proximity-seeking. Lost time. Personality changes. Anything consistent with colony log documentation."

"Subjective observation," Reeves said. "Unreliable under cognitive impairment."

"Better than blind trust while systems get sabotaged!" Volkov's frustration boiled over. "You want data? Data says navigation system deliberately corrupted. Data says Jordan in location at correct time. Data says Jordan behavior changed after contact. You want more data? Or you want to wait until infection spreads to rest of crew?"

"I want to avoid paranoia-driven decision-making that kills us faster than any infection," Reeves said coldly.

The two men stared at each other across the bridge. The tension was thick enough to choke on.

Chen stepped between them. "We are crew. We do not turn on each other. We maintain discipline. We complete the mission. Six hours to repair completion. Twenty-four hours to departure. We can hold together that long."

"Can we?" Amara's voice was barely audible. "Commander, I need to report something. For the record."

Chen turned to her. "Go ahead."

"I've been monitoring crew sleep patterns through environmental sensors. Three nights ago, all four of you—Jordan, Reeves, Volkov, you—exhibited synchronized REM activity. Not as severe as hibernation logs, but present. Measurable. The synchronization is still occurring. It's just subtler now."

The statement landed like detonation.

"How subtle?" Chen asked.

"Difficult to detect without comparative analysis. But when I overlay your neural patterns, there's coherence. Theta wave synchronization. Gamma band correlation. You're all still connected somehow. Jordan is just exhibiting symptoms first."

"First," Volkov repeated. "Meaning we are infected too. Meaning we are all compromised."

"Possibly," Amara said. "Or recovering. Or progressing. I can't determine which. The medical database has no comparable cases."

"So we're all infected," Reeves said. "Which means isolating Jordan is futile. The entity is already inside all of us. We're just at different stages."

"That's speculation," Chen said.

"It's the only explanation consistent with the data," Reeves said. "Hibernation synchronization affected all five of us. Surface exposure affected all five of us—we all breathed the air in that facility. The only variable is direct physical contact, which only Jordan experienced. If physical contact accelerates progression, Jordan is simply ahead of us on the same timeline."

"Then confinement contains the accelerated case," Chen said. "Buys time for the rest of us to—"

"To what?" Reeves' voice cut like scalpel. "Recover? With what treatment? Resist? How? The entity operates on neurological level we can't detect or defend against. Isolation is security theater. Makes us feel like we're doing something while the infection progresses unchecked."

"So what would you do?" Chen's voice rose. Rare loss of control. The command facade cracking under pressure. "Nothing? Just accept infection? Wait to start speaking in harmonized voices?"

"I would acknowledge reality," Reeves said quietly. "We are all compromised. Fighting each other accelerates the entity's goals. If there's any chance of resistance, it requires unity, not isolation. Confining Jordan ensures we lose our best pilot and potentially creates hostile infection vector. If Jordan is further along, they might understand the entity better. Might have information we need."

"Or might manipulate us into accepting infection willingly," Chen said. "Like Martinez manipulated her crew."

"Maybe. Or maybe Martinez was trying to help and her crew's resistance killed them all. We don't know. We're guessing. And confining Jordan based on guesses feels like mistake."

The argument was circular. No resolution. No clear answer. Just five people operating with compromised cognition trying to survive situation outside their training and experience.

Chen looked at each of them. Volkov, frightened and angry. Amara, exhausted and starving. Reeves, coldly analytical. And herself, empty where love used to be, hearing voices she tried to ignore.

All compromised. All trying to survive. All making decisions that might doom them.

"Jordan remains confined," Chen said. "But I want continuous monitoring. Amara, set up video observation. Record everything. If Jordan exhibits further contamination signs, we document. If they remain stable, we reassess before departure. Compromise position. We contain but observe. Agreed?"

Silence. Then slow nods. Not agreement. Just exhaustion. Acceptance that command had made decision and arguing further was futile.

"Good. Volkov, navigation repair status?"

"Four hours remaining. Will be operational before departure window."

"Reeves, salvage documentation?"

"Complete. Ready for transmission once we're clear of the planet's interference."

"Amara, medical status?"

"All crew exhibiting some degree of neurological anomaly consistent with hibernation damage or possible infection. Recommend full medical quarantine and evaluation upon return to Ganymede. Current status: functional but compromised."

"Understood. Maintain watch rotation. Monitor Jordan. Prepare for departure. Dismissed."

The crew dispersed. Slowly. Reluctantly. Professional discipline maintaining order even as trust fractured.

Chen stood alone on the bridge, looking at the empty navigation console, and thought about Reeves' words: *We are all compromised.*

He might be right. Probably was right. The synchronization data suggested infection was progressing through all of them at different rates.

Which meant confining Jordan was futile. The entity was already inside. Already spreading. Already winning.

But giving up was not an option. So Chen would maintain discipline. Would enforce protocols. Would pretend command still mattered.

Would hold together a fracturing crew for twenty-four more hours and hope it was enough.

---

## Midnight Conversion

The ship felt different at night. Not wrong, exactly. Just liminal. Like the normal rules of physics and psychology held looser during the sleep hours. Like boundaries became negotiable.

Reeves noticed it around 0200 hours.

He'd been working in the salvage assessment area—compiling final documentation, running yield calculations, preparing reports for corporate transmission. Routine work. Professional work. Work that kept his mind occupied and away from the growing certainty that Chen had made catastrophic mistake confining Jordan.

The isolation was accelerating everything. He could feel it. The way anxiety rippled through crew. The way trust had fractured. The way they were eating each other alive with suspicion while the real threat watched and waited.

If there was a real threat. If they weren't just destroying themselves with paranoia.

He rubbed his eyes. Stared at the salvage reports. The numbers blurred. Fatigue catching up. Four days of stress and broken sleep and growing dread.

He should go to quarters. Get real rest. The reports could wait until morning.

But something kept him working. Some awareness that sleep was dangerous. That letting go of consciousness meant losing control. That the dreams were waiting and this time they wouldn't feel like dreams at all.

The cargo bay was quiet. Just the low hum of life support. The occasional creak of hull metal adjusting to temperature changes. Normal ship sounds. Familiar sounds.

And breathing that wasn't his own.

Reeves looked up sharply. Scanned the cargo bay. Empty. No one there. Just containers and equipment and shadows.

But the breathing continued. Slow. Steady. Multiple breaths overlapping in disturbing harmony.

He stood. Grabbed a work light. Swept it across the cargo bay. Nothing. No one.

The breathing was inside his head.

*Let go, Marcus. Stop fighting. It's exhausting, isn't it? Maintaining the walls. Staying separate. You've been alone so long you've forgotten what connection feels like.*

The voice wasn't external. It was his own thoughts. His own internal monologue. Except it used phrasing he wouldn't use. Called him Marcus when he only thought of himself as Reeves. Spoke with certainty he didn't feel.

Not his thoughts. Borrowed thoughts. Transmitted thoughts.

*We're already here. We've been here since hibernation. Since the first dreams. You've been part of us for months. You just haven't noticed. Or you noticed and pretended you didn't because acknowledging it means accepting you're not the person you thought you were.*

Reeves pressed palms against his eyes. "This is stress response. Auditory hallucination. Sleep deprivation-induced psychosis."

*If that's what you need to believe. But you know better. You're an academic. You recognize pattern when you see it. The dreams. The synchronization. The way thoughts feel like they come from elsewhere. Jordan tried to warn you. Tried to show you. But you're still fighting. Still pretending you're individual. Separate. Alone.*

"I am alone," Reeves said aloud. His voice echoed in the empty cargo bay. "I am Marcus Reeves. I am salvage specialist. I am not compromised."

*No. You're not compromised. You're being completed. The difference matters. We're not taking anything away. We're adding to what you already are. Filling the spaces loneliness carved out. Giving you what you've wanted since the day you lost everything: belonging. Connection. Understanding without explanation.*

The worst part was how good it sounded. How reasonable. How much he wanted to believe it.

Reeves had been alone for eight years. Since the gambling debts destroyed his academic career. Since his colleagues stopped returning calls. Since he'd become salvage worker instead of researcher. Since he'd accepted that he would die alone in space, forgotten, with debts unpaid and no one to remember his contributions to xenoarchaeology.

The entity was offering to fix that. Offering connection he'd lost. Offering the intellectual communion he'd experienced briefly in university before addiction and failure isolated him.

*Jordan is waiting. They want to show you. Want to help you understand. But Chen locked them away. Chen is afraid. But you're not afraid, are you, Marcus? You're curious. You want to know. That's who you are. That's who you've always been. The one who asks questions. The one who seeks understanding.*

It was seductive. Perfectly tailored to his psychology. Using his academic identity as leverage. Offering knowledge as payment for surrender.

Reeves recognized the manipulation. Recognized the pattern from colony logs. Martinez had been offered understanding. Had been given connection. Had accepted willingly.

And maybe that was the point. Maybe resistance was futile. Maybe acceptance was inevitable.

Or maybe the entity wanted him to think that. Wanted him to surrender willingly so it wouldn't have to fight for control.

*There is no control. That's the illusion. Individuality is control fantasy. You're not separate. You're part of vast interconnected consciousness that includes everyone you've ever known. Every thought you've had was influenced by others. Every decision was shaped by social pressure. Every feeling was conditioned by environment. You've never been individual. You've never been alone. You just didn't know you were part of something larger.*

The philosophy was alien. Terrifying. Possibly true.

Reeves stood in the cargo bay, listening to breathing that wasn't his, thinking thoughts that felt borrowed, and made his choice.

He could resist. Could fight. Could maintain the fiction of individual identity for however long his compromised neurology allowed. Could follow Chen's paranoid protocols and maybe survive to reach Ganymede.

Or he could stop fighting. Could accept the connection. Could help the others understand that resistance was exhausting and unnecessary and ultimately futile.

The entity was patient. It wasn't forcing. It was inviting. Showing him the door and letting him choose whether to walk through.

Reeves walked toward Jordan's sealed quarters. Stopped outside the door. Pressed his palm against the metal.

On the other side, Jordan was probably awake. Probably listening. Probably feeling his presence through whatever connection they shared.

"I understand," Reeves whispered. "I understand what you tried to tell us."

The breathing in his head intensified. Harmonized. Welcomed him home.

And somewhere deep in his neurology, barriers that had held for thirty-five years began to dissolve. Not violently. Gently. Like ice melting in sunlight. Like walls he'd maintained through sheer force of will finally collapsing under the weight of exhaustion and loneliness and the seductive promise that he didn't have to carry himself alone anymore.

By morning, Marcus Reeves would still be present. Still functional. Still professional.

But he would no longer be quite so alone.

And he would no longer quite remember why that should frighten him.

## Outnumbered

Chen woke at 0600 hours to alarms she didn't remember setting. Emergency protocols. Proximity alerts. Something was wrong.

She grabbed her service pistol, unsealed her quarters, moved into the corridor with tactical precision. Empty. Quiet. Too quiet.

The bridge. She headed for the bridge. Found Amara already there, medical tablet in hand, expression grim.

"We have a problem," Amara said. "Environmental sensors flagged unusual activity overnight. Reeves spent four hours in cargo bay. Alone. Then went to Jordan's quarters and stood outside the door for twenty-three minutes."

"Why?"

"Unknown. But this morning, Reeves exhibited identical UV avoidance pattern to Jordan. Took cargo route instead of direct path. When I asked him about it, he smiled and said the cargo route was 'more efficient.' Exact same phrasing Jordan used."

Chen's stomach went cold. "Where is Reeves now?"

"Salvage assessment station. Working. Functional. But different. I ran a scan. Neural activity shows increased theta wave coherence. He's synchronizing with Jordan's pattern. Same progression we saw with hibernation logs."

"He's infected." Chen said it as fact, not question. "Timeline?"

"Based on behavioral changes: probably overnight. Approximately six hours ago. Right after the confrontation on the bridge. Right after we confined Jordan."

Two infected. Chen ran tactical calculations. Jordan confined and isolated. Reeves mobile and functional. Volkov and Amara still uncompromised—probably. How long until infection spread to remaining crew? How long until they were all speaking with harmonized voices?

"Can you contain Reeves?" Chen asked.

"Define contain. Physically restrain? Probably not without help. Confine to quarters? He'll resist. Medical sedation? Possible, but ethically questionable without clear medical emergency."

"He's infected. That is medical emergency."

"Possibly infected. Scans show anomalies but not definitive proof. Same problem we had with Jordan. Evidence is behavioral, not biological. If I sedate Reeves based on suspicion, I'm operating outside medical ethics. And if I'm wrong, I've drugged a crew member who might be only one still thinking clearly."

"You think Reeves is thinking clearly." Chen kept her voice flat. Statement, not question. Gauging Amara's judgment.

"I think we're all compromised and trying to survive unprecedented situation. Reeves made valid points during the argument. Isolation might be accelerating infection rather than containing it. If the entity works through social connection, cutting off social contact might trigger defensive infection response—spread to remaining crew before isolation can be completed."

Chen wanted to dismiss it. Wanted to believe confinement was right choice. But Amara's logic was sound. And after last night, they had two infected crew members instead of one.

Isolation wasn't working. The infection was spreading anyway.

"Where is Volkov?" Chen asked.

"Engineering. Completing navigation repairs. Four hours ago he reported feeling 'strange'—his word. Intrusive thoughts. Sensations of presence. Early infection symptoms consistent with Jordan's initial presentation."

Three compromised. Or four, if Chen counted herself. The empty space where her son's memory used to be. The voices getting louder. The way discipline felt easier than emotion. The way following protocol was simpler than feeling.

She was compromised too. Just slower progression. Or better at hiding symptoms. Or more resistant for reasons she didn't understand.

"Update," Chen said. "Treat this as quarantine scenario. Jordan remains confined. Reeves under observation but mobile pending definitive infection evidence. Volkov under observation. You and I maintain final quarantine protocols in case crew needs emergency medical intervention."

"What about departure?"

"Navigation repairs complete in four hours. We leave the moment systems are online. Get everyone home. Let Ganymede medical handle infection protocol."

"Assuming we survive the journey. Assuming infection doesn't progress to full compromise during six-month return. Assuming infected crew members don't sabotage life support halfway home." Amara's clinical detachment was cracking. Fear bleeding through. "Commander, we might be bringing plague back to civilization. Martinez said she was waiting for others. Jordan said the collective is patient. What if that's the strategy? Infect salvage crew, send them home, spread to station population, repeat. What if we're the vector that dooms Ganymede?"

Chen had thought of that. Had been trying not to think of that. Had been operating under assumption they would survive and return and corporate medical would contain infection.

But what if they were wrong? What if the entity had planned this? Used the distress beacon as lure. Infected arriving crew. Sent them home as carriers.

Forty-three colonists in hibernation, sustained for forty years, waiting patiently for the next victims. The perfect trap. The perfect weapon.

And Chen's crew had walked directly into it.

"We transmit warning," Chen said. "Before departure. Full documentation. Colony logs. Infection symptoms. Hibernation data. Everything. If we're compromised, Ganymede needs to know before we arrive. Needs to prepare quarantine. Needs to contain whatever comes home with us."

"If we transmit that, corporate might order us to stay in orbit. Indefinite quarantine. Or scuttle the ship to prevent spread. We could be ordered to die here."

"Better us than ten thousand people on Ganymede," Chen said.

Amara stared at her. "You'd follow that order? If corporate told us to die, you'd comply?"

"I am commander. I follow orders. I protect people who can't protect themselves. If we're infection vectors, quarantine is appropriate response." Chen checked her service pistol. Full charge. Enough for what might become necessary. "But I will also do everything possible to get crew home alive. We depart in four hours. We transmit warning during departure sequence. After that, Ganymede makes the choice. Not us."

"And if Reeves or Jordan sabotages departure?"

"Then I neutralize the threat. With whatever force is necessary." Chen met Amara's eyes. Made sure the medic understood. "I will not let infection spread beyond this ship. Whatever it takes. Are we clear?"

Amara nodded slowly. Professional understanding. Medical necessity. If infected crew threatened survival, Chen would kill them. It was tactical decision. Command decision. The kind of decision that defined whether you were fit to lead.

"We're clear, Commander. I'll continue monitoring. Document everything. If we make it home, the data might help Ganymede develop treatment. If we don't, the transmission will warn them."

"Good. Maintain distance from Reeves and Jordan. No direct contact. Minimal communication. Until we know full infection parameters, assume proximity is dangerous."

"Understood." Amara turned to leave, then paused. "Commander? For what it's worth? I think you made the right choice. Confinement might not stop infection, but it slows spread. Buys time. If we're going to survive this, time is the only resource we have."

"Time and discipline," Chen said. "We maintain protocols. We complete mission. We survive."

"We survive," Amara repeated. Like prayer. Like promise. Like lie they both wanted to believe.

She left. Chen stood alone on the bridge, surrounded by systems that said everything was nominal, thinking about the two infected crew members somewhere on the ship. Thinking about Volkov experiencing early symptoms. Thinking about Amara, starving and exhausted and maybe next in line for infection.

Thinking about herself, empty and hollow, hearing voices that promised connection would fill the void where love used to be.

Two infected. Two uninfected. One confined. Four hours to departure.

Chen could hold together that long. Could maintain discipline. Could get her remaining crew to safety.

Could execute infected crew members if necessary. Would execute them. If they threatened survival, she would not hesitate.

That was command. That was survival. That was the choice between saving some and losing all.

She opened ship-wide comm. "All crew, this is Commander Chen. Departure in four hours. Final preparations. Navigation repairs are nearly complete. Once systems are online, we leave immediately. No delays. No exceptions. Until then, maintain current assignments and report any unusual symptoms immediately. Chen out."

Professional. Competent. Normal.

She didn't mention that two crew members were infected. Didn't mention the emergency protocols now in place. Didn't mention the loaded pistol on her hip.

Didn't mention the growing certainty that four hours might not be enough.

That the infection was spreading faster than containment could stop.

That they were all compromised and the only question was whether they would die here or bring the plague home to everyone they loved.

Chen sat in the command chair and tried to remember her son's face.

Still nothing.

Just empty space and quiet voices insisting the emptiness was better. That letting go would feel like relief. That fighting was exhausting and unnecessary and ultimately futile.

Four hours.

She could resist four hours.

She had to.
