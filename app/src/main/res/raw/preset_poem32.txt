A Clear Midnight (3s)
by Walt Whitman (3s)

This is thy hour, Oh Soul, (2s)
thy free flight into the wordless, (4s)

Away from books, (2s)
away from art, (2s)
the day erased, (2s)
the lesson done, (4s)

Thee fully forth emerging, (2s)
silent, (2s)
gazing, (2s)
pondering the themes thou lovest best, (4s)

Night, (2s)
sleep, (2s)
death and the stars. (5s)
