Penance (3s)

Something small arrived carrying its own weather. (1s)
You opened the door. The weather stayed. (3s)

Love is not the same as solving. (2s)
Love is the agreement to witness (1s)
what cannot be fixed, (1s)
to choose ruined space (1s)
over simpler place. (3s)

A language older than domestication, (1s)
feral syntax, the grammar of before trust, (2s)
written in signs you've learned to read (1s)
on surfaces you tried to make safe. (3s)

And you, (1s)
decoding these messages in waking hours, (1s)
understanding perfectly (1s)
that responsibility is just another word (1s)
for becoming the radius (1s)
of someone else's wound, (1s)
for mapping the circumference (1s)
of another's fear renewed, (1s)
saying, I know. I'm still here. I've understood. (3s)

The world offers you permission to flee. (1s)
The world is always offering to set you free. (3s)

But obligation has roots that grow backward (1s)
not from what they owe you (1s)
but from what you became (1s)
the moment you said yes (1s)
to something that had already learned (1s)
that yes means nothing, (1s)
that doors close, that safety (1s)
is a trick of light confessed. (3s)

Some bonds are not about joy. (1s)
Some bonds are the choice (1s)
to be haunted willingly, (1s)
to let another's brokenness (1s)
become your daily test, (2s)
because once, without thinking, (1s)
you made a vow (1s)
to something that had stopped (1s)
believing in the rest. (3s)

The walls hold what cannot be spoken. (1s)
Your hands hold what must be done. (3s)

This is love: (1s)
not the fantasy of mutual completion (1s)
but the arithmetic of staying (1s)
calculating daily what you can endure (1s)
one more refutation of everything (1s)
you tried to offer, (1s)
one more proof that kindness (1s)
doesn't cure, doesn't assure, (3s)

and choosing, still, to be the one (1s)
who doesn't disappear. (3s)
