When The Weather Is Warmer (3s)

It is a cold and rainy morning. (1s)
You are at this familiar place. (1s)
Family. (2s)
You know it well (1s) 
but have not been here in quite some time. (3s)

You are making room, (1s)
another spot. (3s)

It is difficult work (1s)
So many roots to cut through (1s)
So very tough and hard to sever (3s)

Closure (2s)

A perfect spot (2s)

Marked to find again (1s)
When the weather is warmer (3s)
