The Snail and the Calendar (3s)

You found a snail on your desk calendar, (1s)
moving diagonally across the grid, (1s)
leaving a silver trail from Thursday (1s)
straight through the weekend (1s)
into next week's Tuesday. (3s)

It doesn't know about deadlines, (1s)
doesn't care that Monday comes before Wednesday, (1s)
has no concept of quarters or fiscal years. (3s)

It just moves (1s)
slowly,  (1s)
steadily, (1s)
following some internal compass (1s)
that has nothing to do with (1s)
the numbered boxes beneath its body. (3s)

All our careful planning, (1s)
our color coded systems, (1s)
our urgent reminders (1s)
the snail slides right through them, (1s)
treating March the same as April, (1s)
Sunday no different from Thursday. (3s)

There's something freeing in watching it, (1s)
this creature operating on snail time, (1s)
which is to say no time at all, (1s)
just the present moment (1s)
and the next bit of surface to cross. (3s)

Maybe we could learn something (1s)
from its slow diagonal journey, (1s)
its refusal to follow the grid, (1s)
its perfect indifference (1s)
to everything we've built (1s)
to contain what cannot be contained. (3s)
