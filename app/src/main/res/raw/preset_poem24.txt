Shadow (3s)

The light begins (2s)
sharp against the wall, (2s)
morning angles, thin (2s)
and barely there at all. (4s)

You watch the shape (2s)
that something casts (2s)
begin to drape (2s)
across the space it lasts. (4s)

By afternoon (2s)
the shadow's stretched, (3s)
distorted soon, (2s)
geometry re-sketched. (4s)

What seemed so small (2s)
at dawn now reaches (2s)
wall to wall, (2s)
elongates and stretches. (4s)

You've been here (2s)
watching it extend, (3s)
the slow measure (2s)
of how a day can bend. (4s)

The shadow shows (2s)
what casts it—proof (2s)
in how it grows (2s)
of something's presence, truth. (4s)

But as dusk falls (2s)
the edges blur. (3s)
Shadow crawls (2s)
into the wall entire. (4s)

No longer clear (2s)
where shadow ends (2s)
or if it's here (2s)
or if the darkness blends. (4s)

You watched all day (2s)
the changing line, (3s)
the slow display (2s)
of how light marks the time. (5s)
