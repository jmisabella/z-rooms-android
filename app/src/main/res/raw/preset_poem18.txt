Geometries Unknown (3s)

They traveled to places silence keeps, (1.5s)
where dust lies centuries deep (1s)
and wind scrapes bone-dry stone. (2s)

Beneath the drifts: (1s)
chambers vast enough to swallow light, (2s)
angles that bend perception, (1.5s)
doorways carved for frames we've never known. (2.5s)

Not ruins. (1.5s)
Something stranger. (1.5s)
Cathedrals engineered by minds (1s)
that calculated in dimensions we still can't read, (2s)
that built for permanence (1.5s)
and then disappeared. (3.5s)

The searchers stand small (1s)
in passages that dwarf their instruments. (2s)
Every surface worked with purpose— (1.5s)
no decoration, only precision. (2s)
As if the stone itself were a language (1.5s)
and they're still learning the alphabet. (3s)

Who were they? (2s)
What did they see from these windows (1.5s)
when there were eyes to see, (1s)
when these halls held breath and footfall? (2.5s)
What calculations filled these spaces (1.5s)
before the silence moved in? (4s)

The comfort comes quietly: (2s)
we are not first. (1.5s)
Not alone in wanting to build something (1.5s)
that outlasts us, (1s)
in loving pattern and form, (1.5s)
in speaking to a future we won't see. (3.5s)

Others reached for permanence too. (2s)
Others made beauty in the emptiness. (2.5s)
And here we stand, reading their whispers, (1.5s)
learning how much we don't yet know. (4s)
