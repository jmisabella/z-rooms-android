Geometries Unknown (3s)

They traveled far to places no one goes, (1s)
to barren lands where silence holds its breath, (1s)
and found beneath the ancient drifts of dust (1s)
something that time forgot, that escaped death. (3s)

Not ruins, no, (1s)
too grand a word, too small (1s)
these were cathedrals carved from living stone, (1s)
with geometries that shouldn't stand at all, (1s)
built by minds working methods still unknown. (3s)

The scale alone defied imagination, (1s)
chambers that stretched beyond where light could reach, (1s)
speaking of patience, purpose, calculation, (1s)
a language that the ages couldn't teach. (3s)

Who were they, these architects of old, (1s)
who shaped such beauty in this barren place? (1s)
What truths did they discover, what stories told (1s)
before they vanished, leaving barely a trace? (3s)

The searchers stood in reverent awe, (1s)
humbled by the magnitude of what they'd found, (1s)
realizing everything they thought they saw (1s)
of history was just the surface ground. (3s)

There's comfort, strangely, in this ancient mystery, (1s)
in knowing we're not first, not last, not alone, (1s)
that intelligence and wonder thread through history, (1s)
that others loved beauty, carved it into stone. (3s)

We are so young, we think we realize truths, (1s)
but here's evidence of depths we've yet to sound (1s)
civilizations risen, fallen, out of touch, (1s)
leaving only whispers in the silent ground. (3s)
