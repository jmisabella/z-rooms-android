Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this (4s)

Every breath you take connects you to everything. (1.5s)
The trees that made the oxygen… (1.5s)
The air that's been here for billions of years… (1.5s)
You're breathing the same air as ancient humans… (1s)
As dinosaurs. (2s)
You're never separate. (6s)

Close your eyes… (1.5s) and breathe. (5s)

This is a practice of coherent breathing. (3s)
We breathe in for five… (1s)
Hold for five… (1s)
And out for five. (2s)
This rhythm brings the heart and breath into harmony. (6s)

Let's begin together. (2s)
In for five… (0.3s)
One (1s)
Two (1s)
Three (1s)
Four (1s)
Five (2s)

Hold for five… (0.3s)
Two (0.9s)
Three (0.9s)
Four (0.9s)
Five (2s)

Out for five… (0.3s)
Two (1s)
Three (1s)
Four (1s)
Five (3s)

Again. (0.5s)
In… (1.3s) two… (1s) three… (1s) four… (1s) five… (2s)
Hold… (1.3s) two… (0.9s) three… (0.9s) four… (0.9s) five… (2s)
Out… (1.3s) two… (1s) three… (1s) four… (1s) five… (3s)

One more guided round. (1s)
In… (1.3s) two… (1s) three… (1s) four… (1s) five… (2s)
Hold… (1.3s) two… (0.9s) three… (0.9s) four… (0.9s) five… (2s)
Out… (1.3s) two… (1s) three… (1s) four… (1s) five… (4s)

Now continue this rhythm on your own. (2s)
Five in… (1s) five hold… (1s) five out. (16s)

Feel the steadiness of this pattern. (3s)
Like waves… (2s)
Consistent… (1.5s) reliable… (1.5s) calming. (8s)

Keep breathing in this rhythm. (14s)

This is your natural coherence. (3s)
Body and mind… (1.5s)
Breath and heart… (1.5s)
In harmony. (10s)

When you're ready… (2.5s)
Let the pattern go… (2s)
Breathe naturally… (3s)
And open your eyes. (4s)
