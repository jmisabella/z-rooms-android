Green Transaction (3s)

What the surface refuses to name (1s)
arrives anyway—a fever (2s)
of breaking open, unzipping (1s)
the small rooms where light (1s)
has been sleeping in its clothes. (3s)

There is a mathematics here (1s)
that doesn't count, a commerce (1s)
without coins: the air (2s)
empties its invisible pockets, (1s)
brightness spends itself reckless. (3s)

Inside the machinery, (2s)
a thousand tiny mouths (1s)
breathe backward, swallowing (1s)
what the sky exhales, (1s)
turning absence into structure. (3s)

This is how the world (1s)
learns to consume radiance (2s)
not with teeth but with waiting, (1s)
not with wanting but with (1s)
the slow alchemy of surrender. (3s)

What enters as ghost (1s)
leaves as sweetness, as the hidden (1s)
geometry of being. (3s)

The surface asks nothing, (1s)
offers everything, (3s)

becomes the translation (1s)
we didn't know we needed— (2s)
the syntax of continuation (1s)
written in that ancient, (1s)
illegible color. (4s)
