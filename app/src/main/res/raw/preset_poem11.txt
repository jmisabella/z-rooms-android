The Green Transaction (3s)

What the leaf refuses to name (1s)
arrives anyway—a fever (1s)
of breaking open, unzipping (1s)
the small rooms where light (1s)
has been sleeping in its clothes. (3s)

There is a mathematics here (1s)
that doesn't count, a commerce (1s)
without coins: the air (1s)
gives up its invisible cargo, (1s)
the sun spends itself reckless. (3s)

Inside the green machinery, (1s)
a thousand tiny mouths (1s)
breathe backward, swallowing (1s)
the sky's exhalation, (1s)
turning hunger into architecture. (3s)

This is how the world (1s)
learns to eat light (1s)
not with teeth but with patience, (1s)
not with wanting but with (1s)
the slow alchemy of surrender. (3s)

What enters as ghost (1s)
leaves as sugar, as the sweet (1s)
architecture of being. (2s)

The leaf asks nothing, (1s)
offers everything, (2s)

becomes the translation (1s)
we didn't know we needed (1s)
the syntax of survival (1s)
written in chlorophyll, (1s)
that ancient, illegible green. (3s)
