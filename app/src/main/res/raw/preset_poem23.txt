Suspended (3s)

The fog arrives without asking, (2s)
settling into the space between (1s)
what you can see (1s)
and what you thought you knew. (3s)

It doesn't erase the world, (2s)
just softens its edges, (2s)
reduces everything to a radius (1s)
of ten feet, then five, (2s)
then the length of your arm. (4s)

Sound changes first. (2s)

Footsteps you'd hear from a block away (1s)
now appear suddenly, close, (2s)
voices muffled into intimacy (1s)
whether they want it or not. (3s)

The air becomes something you can feel (2s)
not just breathe— (1s)
cool moisture gathering (1s)
on your skin, your hair, (2s)
each exhalation visible, (2s)
proof that you're here, (1s)
exhaling into gray. (4s)

You walk slower without deciding to. (2s)
Not from fear, just— (2s)
attention. (3s)

The ground appears beneath your feet (1s)
one step at a time, (2s)
the rest held in suspension, (2s)
hovering between forms (1s)
the way certainty sometimes does. (4s)

There's something almost honest (2s)
about this limited vision, (2s)
the way it admits (1s)
what was always true: (3s)

You never could see very far ahead. (3s)

The fog just makes it obvious. (3s)

The distant hills (1s)
you were walking toward, (1s)
the long view, (1s)
the path stretching out (1s)
with all its decisions visible— (3s)

Gone. (2s)

Just this step. (2s)
Just this breath. (2s)
Just what's here. (5s)
