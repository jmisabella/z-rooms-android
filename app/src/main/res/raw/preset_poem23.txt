Suspended (3s)

The fog arrives without asking, (2s)
settling into the space between (1s)
what you can see (1s)
and what you thought you knew. (3s)

It doesn't erase the world, (2s)
just softens its edges, (2s)
reduces everything to a radius (1s)
of ten feet, then five, (2s)
then the length of your arm. (4s)

Sound changes first. (2s)

Footsteps you'd hear from a block away (1s)
now appear suddenly, close, (2s)
voices muffled into intimacy (1s)
whether they want it or not. (3s)

The air becomes something you can feel (2s)
not just breathe— (1s)
cool moisture gathering (1s)
on your skin, your hair, (2s)
each exhalation visible, (2s)
proof that you're here, (1s)
exhaling into gray. (4s)

You walk slower without deciding to. (2s)
Not from fear, just— (2s)
attention. (3s)

The ground appears beneath your feet (1s)
one step at a time, (2s)
the rest held in suspension, (2s)
water refusing to commit (1s)
to either air or rain, (2s)
hovering between forms (1s)
the way certainty sometimes does. (4s)

There's something almost honest (2s)
about this limited vision, (2s)
the way it admits (1s)
what was always true: (3s)

You never could see very far ahead. (2s)

The fog just makes it obvious, (1s)
builds a world (1s)
from what's immediately present— (2s)
this curb, this fence, (1s)
this tree emerging slowly (1s)
as you approach, (2s)
then dissolving behind you (1s)
back into the gray. (4s)

You could call this disorienting. (2s)

You could call it (1s)
a kind of relief. (4s)

The distant hills (1s)
you were walking toward, (1s)
the long view, (1s)
the path stretching out (1s)
with all its decisions visible— (3s)

Gone. (2s)

Just this step. (2s)
Just this breath. (2s)
Just what's here. (4s)

The fog doesn't lift. (2s)
Doesn't promise to. (3s)

You keep walking anyway, (2s)
learning the particular texture (1s)
of not-knowing, (2s)
how it dampens panic (1s)
the same way it dampens sound, (3s)
how uncertainty (1s)
held long enough (2s)
becomes a kind of place, (3s)

somewhere you can stand, (2s)
breathe, (2s)
keep moving forward (1s)
into the gray— (3s)

not blind, (1s)
just focused (2s)
on what's near enough (1s)
to touch. (5s)
