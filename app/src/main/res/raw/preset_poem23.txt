The Finch at the Feeder (3s)

You noticed him because he didn't leave (1s)
all the other birds scattered when you approached the window, (1s)
but this one stayed, small body trembling, (1s)
feathers around his eyes and face disturbed, (1s)
something clearly wrong. (3s)

Mange, you suspected, or mites, (1s)
some invasion that left him (1s)
too weak or too weary to care about your presence, (1s)
just a few feet of glass between (1s)
his suffering and your witnessing. (3s)

He rested more than he ate, (1s)
small chest rising and falling with effort, (1s)
occasionally pecking at seeds (1s)
as if remembering what he was supposed to do, (1s)
then returning to that shivering stillness. (1s)
You checked on him after work, (1s)
gone, (3s)

which brought both relief and worry. (1s)
Was he healing somewhere? (1s)
Had he found a quieter place? (1s)
Or had the suffering ended in a way you didn't want to imagine? (3s)

The next morning he was back, (1s)
still sick, still trembling, (1s)
and you stood there with your coffee (1s)
thinking about calling someone, (1s)
wondering who you even call for a sick wild bird, (1s)
feeling the weight of wanting to help (1s)
and not knowing how. (3s)

And then he was gone for good. (3s)

You still don't know what happened (1s)
if he recovered and moved on, (1s)
if he's at someone else's feeder now, (1s)
strong enough to fly away when they get close, (1s)
or if he died alone in the branches (1s)
of that nearby tree. (3s)

The not knowing sits with you. (1s)
The image of him trembling. (1s)
The question of what you could have done differently, (1s)
whether your inaction was kindness or cowardice, (1s)
whether he needed intervention or just (1s)
a place to rest undisturbed. (3s)

Maybe the lesson isn't in the ending. (1s)
Maybe it's in the presence (1s)
that you noticed, (1s)
that you cared enough to look closely, (1s)
to check on him, (1s)
to hold space for his struggle (1s)
even when you couldn't fix it. (3s)

Sometimes bearing witness is all we can offer. (1s)
Sometimes keeping the feeder full (1s)
is the only help we have to give. (3s)

The finch taught you something about limits, (1s)
about the nature of care, (1s)
about how hard it is to sit with suffering (1s)
you can't solve, (1s)
only see. (3s)

You hope he made it. (1s)
You hope he didn't suffer long. (1s)
You hope, in some small way, (1s)
that your attention mattered (1s)
that being seen, even in his sickness, (1s)
was something. (3s)
