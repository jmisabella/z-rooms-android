Old Rooms (3s)

You thought you'd closed those doors for good, (1s)
locked them tight and walked away, (1s)
convinced that time had done what it should, (1s)
turned the night of then to day. (3s)

But here you are, your hand upon the latch, (1s)
drawn back to rooms you swore you'd left, (1s)
picking at the careful patch (1s)
you placed across each tender cleft. (3s)

The scars you wear were once raw wounds, (1s)
they bled and hurt and finally sealed, (1s)
or so you thought beneath the moon's (1s)
quiet watch as you slowly healed. (3s)

But healing isn't always straight, (1s)
sometimes the threads pull loose again, (1s)
and you must sit and contemplate (1s)
the tangled origins of pain. (3s)

There's no shame in reopening doors, (1s)
in stepping back through rooms you fled, (1s)
in tracing paths along old floors (1s)
to understand where they once led. (3s)

Perhaps they never fully closed, (1s)
perhaps you only dimmed the light, (1s)
left certain feelings uncomposed, (1s)
certain questions locked from sight. (3s)

So sit with them a little while, (1s)
these echoes that refuse to fade, (1s)
examine them without denial, (1s)
the choices made, the prices paid. (3s)

The paths that brought you here still matter, (1s)
they're woven into who you are, (1s)
and understanding why they shatter (1s)
might be how you heal the scar. (3s)

You don't have to fix it all tonight, (1s)
just acknowledge what remains, (1s)
that some doors need the morning light, (1s)
that wisdom sometimes comes with pain. (3s)
