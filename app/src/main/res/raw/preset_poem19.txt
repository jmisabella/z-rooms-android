The Weight (3s)

It starts in the morning, (2s)
before I'm fully awake, (2s)
settling on my chest (1s)
like something that's been waiting. (3s)

Not heavy enough to name. (2s)
Not light enough to ignore. (3s)

I go through the motions. (2s)
Make coffee, (1s)
check the time, (1s)
remind myself (1s)
that nothing is wrong, (2s)
nothing has happened, (3s)

but my hands know better. (2s)

They shake when I'm not watching, (2s)
grip things harder than they need to, (2s)
as if preparing (1s)
for something to be taken. (4s)

The feeling has no name, (2s)
no face, (1s)
no reason I can point to, (3s)

but it knows me. (2s)

It knows when I'm about to relax, (2s)
when I'm close to forgetting, (2s)
and it tightens, (1s)
just enough (1s)
to pull me back. (4s)

I've stopped asking what it wants. (3s)

I've stopped waiting for it to arrive. (3s)

It's already here. (2s)

It's been here. (2s)

And I don't know (2s)
what I'm preparing for, (2s)
only that I'm always, (2s)
always preparing. (5s)
