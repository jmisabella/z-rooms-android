The Blue Hour (3s)

You've learned to call it evening, (2s)
but the technical term is civil twilight— (1s)
that window when the sun (1s)
six degrees below the world's edge (2s)
still illuminates the sky (1s)
from beneath. (4s)

Twenty minutes of this. (2s)
Sometimes thirty. (3s)

The source is gone. (2s)
The light remains. (3s)

Everything turns a particular blue (1s)
that doesn't exist at any other hour— (2s)
not the blue of day or the blue of distance, (1s)
but the blue of in-between, (2s)
light scattered through the upper atmosphere (1s)
from a sun you cannot see. (4s)

Look for it if you want. (2s)
Trace the brightness to its origin. (3s)

You won't find it. (3s)

The source has slipped below the line (1s)
where earth curves away, (2s)
but its light continues (1s)
moving through particles of air, (1s)
arriving here (1s)
from nowhere you can point to. (4s)

It's the physics of absence: (2s)
brightness that proves (1s)
what isn't there. (4s)

You know this state. (2s)

Being certain of something (1s)
you can't locate. (2s)
Feeling the effects (1s)
of a cause that's disappeared (1s)
below your personal horizon (2s)
but continues, somehow, (1s)
to illuminate. (4s)

Not hope— (2s)
hope is warmer than this, (1s)
more golden. (3s)

This is cooler. (2s)
More exact. (3s)

The precision of standing (1s)
in light from an absent star, (2s)
neither day's glare (1s)
nor night's relief, (2s)
just this measured blue, (2s)
this window (1s)
when contradictions hold— (3s)

gone and present, (1s)
below and above, (1s)
invisible and luminous— (2s)

all of it true, (1s)
all at once. (4s)

The blue hour doesn't resolve. (2s)

It just operates, (2s)
patient as physics, (1s)
for twenty minutes, (1s)
sometimes thirty, (2s)
then shifts into something else (1s)
without apology. (4s)

You stand in it while it lasts, (2s)
lit by what isn't there, (2s)
learning the particular texture (1s)
of sustained impossibility— (3s)

how it doesn't ask you (1s)
to understand it, (2s)
only to notice (1s)
that here you are, (2s)
visible, (2s)
illuminated, (3s)

standing in the proof (1s)
of something (1s)
six degrees below. (5s)
