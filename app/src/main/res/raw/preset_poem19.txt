Old Rooms (3s)

You thought the door was locked. (1.5s)
Years of dust settling in the crack beneath it, (1s)
the key lost or thrown away— (1.5s)
it doesn't matter which. (2.5s)

But your hand finds the latch anyway. (2s)
Muscle memory, maybe, (1s)
or the way certain silences (1.5s)
pull you back to their source. (3s)

Inside: familiar shadows. (2s)
The same furniture, (1s)
though you remember moving it, (1.5s)
rearranging everything (1s)
so it would look different, (1.5s)
so you could claim you'd changed. (3.5s)

The air tastes like it did. (2s)
Strange how the body remembers (1.5s)
what the mind insists it forgot— (1.5s)
the exact weight in your chest, (1.5s)
the way your throat tightens (1s)
around words you never said. (4s)

You meant to just glance in. (1.5s)
Check that it was still empty, still sealed. (2s)
Instead you're sitting on the floor (1.5s)
in the corner you always sat in, (1s)
touching the baseboards (1.5s)
where the paint is worn smooth. (3.5s)

Healing, you've learned, (2s)
is not a line but a spiral. (2s)
You pass the same landmarks (1.5s)
from different angles, (1s)
seeing what you missed before (1.5s)
or what you weren't ready to see. (4s)

The room hasn't changed. (2s)
You have. (2s)
That's why you can sit here now (1.5s)
without the old panic, (1s)
why you can touch the walls (1.5s)
and feel both the ache and the distance. (4.5s)

Tomorrow you might close the door again. (2s)
Or leave it cracked, (1.5s)
let some light spill in. (2s)
Either way, (1s)
the room was always part of the house. (2s)
Pretending otherwise (1.5s)
just meant walking carefully around it, (1.5s)
always aware of what you were avoiding. (4s)
