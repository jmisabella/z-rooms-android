Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1.8s)

The child you were still resides inside you. (2s)
Still remembers how to play, (1s) how to wonder, (1s)
How to be fully alive. (3s)
That child is waiting for you. (6s)

Find a comfortable seat… (0.5s) or lie down if that's more comfortable… (0.8s) and when you're ready, (0.5s) gently close your eyes. (4.5s)

Take a gentle breath in… (4s)
And out… (5s)
In… (4s)
Out… (5s)

This is a meditation for your inner child. (2s)
The part of you that still remembers how to play. (3s)
How to wonder. (2s)
How to be fully present. (5s)

Picture yourself as a child. (2s)
Maybe five or six years old. (2.5s)
Notice what you looked like. (4s)

See that child clearly. (2s)
Really look at them. (5s)

This child is still inside you. (2s)
Always has been. (6s)

Now imagine that child is worried. (2s)
Maybe scared of something. (2s)
Needing comfort. (4s)

Consider what you would say to them. (3s)

Maybe… (1s)
"You're safe." (3s)
"I'm here with you." (3s)
"You don't have to be afraid." (3s)
"I've got you." (5s)

Feel yourself as the adult, (1s)
Caring for your inner child. (3s)
Protecting them. (2s)
Comforting them. (5s)

Place a hand on your heart. (3s)
This is where your inner child exists. (3s)
Right here. (2s)
Always with you. (6s)

Breathe love to that child. (2s)
The child you were. (1.5s)
The child you still are. (6s)

They didn't get everything they needed back then. (2.5s)
But you can give it to them now. (3s)
Safety. (2s)
Love. (2s)
Acceptance. (5s)

"You are loved." (4s)
"You are safe." (4s)
"You are exactly enough." (6s)

Feel that child relaxing. (2.5s)
Smiling maybe. (2s)
Trusting you. (5s)

You can visit this child anytime. (2s)
They need you. (1.5s)
And you need them… (1.5s)
To remember how to be free. (8s)

Rest with your inner child. (14s)

When it feels right… (2s)
Thank them for being with you… (1.5s)
Gently stretch… (1.5s)
Slowly opening eyes with your inner child safe. (2s)
To rest, (1s) stay together here, child and guardian as one, (1s) resting safely into sleep. (5s)
