The z rooms app has 35 available looping audio files for sleeping, guided meditation, chilling out, and waking up. Its audio files are of 4 styles: white noise, dark ambient, bright ambient, and classical compositions. People set a duration (or infinite) of the listening session and when it's completed the audio either fades to zero or fades into a different audio file for waking up.

## Text-to-Speech for Guided Stories and Poetry Readings

We've added text to speech functionality. Now users can optionally toggle on a random guided story that accompanies the existing app functionality, playing the guided story narration voice over the ambient audio. There are 35 prewritten guided stories. We plan to also soon have 35 prewritten poems for poetry mode. 

**Voice Options:**
- **Default Voice (Free, No Download):** The default voice has an intentionally artificial, robotic, synthesized quality that creates an interesting meditative atmosphere. This was actually a happy accident that works surprisingly well for meditation and poems. The app remains 100% offline, free, ad-free, subscription-free, and about 110MB in size.
- **Enhanced Voices (Optional):** Users can optionally enable enhanced, more natural-sounding voices through a settings menu accessible inside each room (gear icon, leftmost button). Many enhanced voices come pre-installed on newer devices (iPhone 16, etc.), while some may require download (100-500MB each). These are iOS system voices, not bundled with the app. Enhanced voices can be managed and deleted via iOS Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → Voices.

**Custom Stories and Custom Poems:**
Users can also write their OWN custom stories and poems, and save up to 35 custom stories and 35 custom poems. We even have it so users can set pause breaks between words: (2s) or (1.5m) for example. If user deletes all of their custom stories, the default custom story comes back so they can have a nice example one with pauses that they can start with, and they can duplicate stories to make it easy on them.

**Closed Captions:**
There is a closed caption feature which, when enabled, displays the story being spoken in text form along the bottom of the screen. This optional feature is enabled by default.

**Multiple Voice Offerings**
User can select from a variety of voices, already offered by iOS/Android ecosystems. While most of these voices may already be readily available on most devices, some may need to be downloaded as a system download to the device.
