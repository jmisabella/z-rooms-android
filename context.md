The z rooms app has 35 available looping audio files for sleeping, guided story, chilling out, and waking up. Its audio files are of 4 styles: white noise, dark ambient, bright ambient, and classical compositions. People set a duration (or infinite) of the listening session and when it's completed the audio either fades to zero or fades into a different audio file for waking up.

## Text-to-Speech for Guided Stories and Poetry Readings

We've added text to speech functionality. Now users can optionally toggle on a random guided story that accompanies the existing app functionality, playing the guided story narration voice over the ambient audio. There are 35 prewritten guided stories. We plan to also soon have 35 prewritten poems for poetry mode. 

**Voice Options:**
- **Default Voice (Free, No Download):** When enhanced voices are disabled, the app uses your device's default text-to-speech voice, which has a more artificial, robotic quality that creates an interesting meditative atmosphere for dark sci-fi stories. This was actually a happy accident that works surprisingly well for the content. The app remains 100% offline, free, ad-free, subscription-free, and about 110MB in size.
- **Enhanced Voices (Optional, Curated):** Users can optionally enable enhanced voices through a settings menu accessible inside each room (gear icon, leftmost button). The app filters available voices to those suitable for dark sci-fi narration (British, Australian, Indian, and American English variants). These are system voices provided by your device's Text-to-Speech engine, not bundled with the app. Some may require download (100-500MB each) via device settings (Android: Settings → System → Languages & input → Text-to-speech output; iOS: Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → Voices).

**Custom Stories and Custom Poems:**
Users can also write their OWN custom stories and poems, and save up to 35 custom stories and 35 custom poems. We even have it so users can set pause breaks between words: (2s) or (1.5m) for example. If user deletes all of their custom stories, the default custom story comes back so they can have a nice example one with pauses that they can start with, and they can duplicate stories to make it easy on them.

**Closed Captions:**
There is a closed caption feature which, when enabled, displays the story being spoken in text form along the bottom of the screen. This optional feature is enabled by default.

**Voice Filtering:**
Enhanced voices are curated to match the dark, contemplative tone of the stories and poems. The app prioritizes British English voices for their serious tone, followed by Australian, Indian, and American English variants. Overly cheerful or bright-sounding voices are excluded from the selection. The filtering ensures:
- **Accepted locales:** British English (en-GB), Australian English (en-AU), Indian English (en-IN), and American English (en-US)
- **Quality requirements:** Excludes low-quality voices
- **Offline capability:** Excludes voices that require network connection
- **Automatic prioritization:** British English voices are selected first for their narrative-appropriate tone

**Multiple Voice Offerings:**
Users can select from curated voices already offered by iOS/Android ecosystems. While most of these voices may already be readily available on most devices, some may need to be downloaded as a system download to the device.
